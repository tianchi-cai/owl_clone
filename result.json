In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

However, upon running an extended simulation with 100,000 iterations, it was found that ball number 1 actually has the highest probability of being ejected first.

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing at total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\n## References\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon Wikia (2017) Toothless (Franchise), 8 March 2017. \\[Online\\].

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled $716,{\\\\mathsf{k g.}}$ Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing at total of $8592~\\\\mathsf{k g}$ over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe How to Train Your Dragon franchise is loosely based on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell \\[1\\]. The events take place in Viking Scotland, in the small village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by dragons. One of the deadliest dragon species is the Night Fury, which was previously unseen by any living person. It is described as the “unholy offspring of lightning and death itself” due to its speed and camouflage abilities \\[2\\]. Toothless is the only known Night Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and playful while also deadly.\n\nHiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the main protagonist, is a small teenage boy eager to prove himself as a Viking. Using an invention which closely resembles a net gun, Hiccup strikes down Toothless during a dragon raid. Toothless’ left caudal fin is severed, rendering him unable to fly out of the sunken area, known as The Cove \\[3\\]. Fish are a large component of a dragon’s diet, and Toothless is exclusively dependent on fish for nutrition \\[4\\]. This paper investigates whether Hiccup is able to maintain Toothless’ feeding habits while he is trapped in The Cove.\n\n# Assumptions\n\nSeveral assumptions and simplifications must be made to calculate the required values. During the time lapse montages in the film, it is taken that Toothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days \\[5\\]. It is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the duration of Toothless’ stay.\n\nOn the third day, Hiccup brings a sack of fish, and mentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon. There is also a pond in the clearing, and one scene shows Toothless hunting for fish. However, in this paper, it is assumed that Toothless relies solely on Hiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is assumed that his diet consists of only salmon and cod. It is also assumed that each sack contained the same amount of fish, and that he received the same amount every day for twelve days.\n\nThe sack is modelled as a cylinder, while the fish have been modelled as prolate spheroids (see Appendix for visual aids).\n\n![](https://journals.le.ac.uk/tmp/3ff849f6-dde3-42f3-9a94-506a708b3294/images/7b59b2c9023d83a5f35b72cc4ed1470c2fce8a8c59f7872266f151105a46019e.jpg)\n\nFigure 1 – Comparison of size of Hiccup to bag \\[5\\].\n\n# Size of the bag\n\nHiccup is said to be $1.625,\\\\mathrm{m}$ tall \\[6\\], and using average male proportions, the bag appears to be $3/8$ of his height \\[7\\]. Therefore, the height of the bag, $H\\_{b a g}$ :\n\n$$\nH\\_{b a g}\\\\approx{\\\\frac{3}{8}}(1.625,m)\\\\approx0.6094,m\n$$\n\nThe bag appears to have the same height as the diameter; the diameter is taken to be $0.6094,\\\\textsf{m}$ .Hence the radius, $r$ :\n\n$$\nr={\\\\frac{1}{2}}(0.6094)=0.3047,m\n$$\n\nSo, the volume of the bag, $V\\_{b a g}$ is:\n\n$$\nV\\_{b a g}=\\\\pi r^{2}h\n$$\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{{V\\_{b a g}=\\\\pi\\\\times(0.3047,m)^{2}\\\\times(0.6094,m)}}\\ {{\\\\therefore,V\\_{b a g}=0.1777,m^{3}}}\\\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the bag has a capacity of $0.1777;\\\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ .\n\n# Fish sizes\n\nThe fish considered in Toothless’ diet are Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar \\[8\\], and Icelandic cod, Gadus morhua \\[9\\]. The average dimensions are summarised in Table 1.\n\n![](https://journals.le.ac.uk/tmp/3ff849f6-dde3-42f3-9a94-506a708b3294/images/b4e0e4e72a2e9e90cdbfeefe614482f6c9879b13df06022131cdf61369d025f3.jpg)\n\nTable 1 – Dimensions of fish\n\nThe length of salmon was calculated by comparing to Hiccup’s height \\[7\\]; the salmon was determined to be $1/4$ of his height. The width was then established by tracing the image and comparing the ratio of the length to width. This was replicated for cod. The values were close to the lower estimates in Table 1; the final values used are summarised in Table 2.\n\n![](https://journals.le.ac.uk/tmp/3ff849f6-dde3-42f3-9a94-506a708b3294/images/b17204b23ae2171f7121fdbb35f61934d244f387a3913260c5d656fc20c94709.jpg)\n\nTable 2 – Dimensions of fish used for calculations\n\nThe volume of a prolate spheroid, $V\\_{p s}$ :\n\n$$\nV\\_{p s}=\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi a^{2}c\n$$\n\nWhere $a=1/2$ width, $c=1/2$ length and $a<c;a$ is the radius and $c$ half the head-to-tail length. Therefore, for salmon $a=0.043$ and $c=0.203$ , and\n\nfor cod $a=0.078$ and $c=0.275$ . Using Eq. (5) the volumes of the salmon, $V\\_{S},$ , and cod, $V\\_{C}.$ , are hence:\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{l}{{V\\_{S}={\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{4}{3}}\\\\pi(0.043)^{2}(0.203)=0.0016,m^{3}}}\\ {{\\\\nonumber\\\\phantom{\\\\frac{4}{3}}{V\\_{C}={\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{4}{3}}\\\\pi(0.078)^{2}(0.275)}=0.0071,m^{3}}}\\\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the volumes of each salmon and cod are 0.0016 and $0.0071;\\\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ respectively.\n\n# Portion size\n\nThe number of each fish, $N\\_{S}$ and $N\\_{C}$ , is multiplied by the volumes from Eq. (6) and (7) respectively. This is equal to the total volume of the bag from Eq. (4):\n\n$$\n0.1777=0.0016N\\_{S}+0.0071N\\_{C}\n$$\n\nIt is assumed that the salmon and cod occupy the same volumes in the bag, and that they are efficiently packed so the entire sack is occupied. Therefore;\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{0.0889=0.0016N\\_{S}}\\ {\\\\therefore N\\_{S}=56}\\\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{0.0889=0.0071N\\_{C}}\\ {\\\\therefore N\\_{C}=13}\\\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe masses of the fishes are:\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{r l}&{M\\_{S}=56(3.5,k g)=196.0,k g}\\ &{M\\_{C}=25(40,k g)=520.0,k g}\\\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTherefore, in one day the bag contains 56 salmon and 13 cod, with a total weight of $716.0,\\\\mathrm{kg}$ .\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn the film, it appears that Toothless was in The Cove for twelve days and it was assumed that he was solely dependent on Hiccup for nutrition. The bag used to provide food was calculated as having a capacity of $0.1777;\\\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ , and could hold 56 Atlantic salmon and 13 Icelandic cod. Hiccup would have to carry $716~\\\\mathrm{kg}$ of fish to The Cove every day, a total of $8592;\\\\mathrm{kg}$ over the period of twelve days. Hiccup is depicted as physically weak, and is unable to even hold up a shield for a prolonged time. It is therefore concluded that Hiccup would be unable to carry the bag and could not feed Toothless for the duration of his time in The Cove, unless he made several trips, used less heavy fish, or didn’t fully fill the sack.\n\n# References\n\n\\[1\\] How to Train Your Dragon Wikia (2017) Toothless (Franchise) , 8 March 2017. \\[Online\\].

              "# Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\n\n## Authors\n\n- Amal Doua\n\nThe Centre for Interdisciplinary Science, University of Leicester\n\n\n## Keywords:\n\nFilm, Biology, Nutrition, Dragon, Toothless, How to Train Your Dragon\n\n## Abstract\n\nToothless is a Night Fury dragon who appears in the _How to Train Your Dragon_ (HTTYD) franchise, and is said to be the rarest, fastest, and most intelligent of the dragon species. In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing at total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\n## References\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon Wikia (2017) Toothless (Franchise), 8 March 2017. \\[Online\\].

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 2010 Kevin Kelly \\[1\\] suggested that the web\n\ncontained approximately one trillion web pages. Whether\n\nthis figure is correct or not, the amount is likely to be\n\nmore in 2015 than in 2010\\. Furthermore, most web pages\n\nare not entities in isolation, but in most cases web pages\n\nmake up the content of web sites, i.e. a web site is likely\n\nto contain two or more web pages.\n\nAlso, most web sites containing several web\n\npages will tend to have a navigation mechanism or\n\nstructure to allow users to navigate from one page to\n\nanother within a particular site.\n\nDepending on how the navigation structure is\n\ndesigned, this can either create a good or bad user\n\nexperience (UX). The researchers in this paper are\n\ninvestigating the usability of different types of menus on\n\nweb pages. While there have been other researchers\n\ninvestigating these issues, it could appear that there is no\n\nmore work left to do in this area. However, when one\n\nlooks collectively at the results of these other studies,\n\nthere is no overall consistent pattern of results to suggest\n\nthat one menu type is much better than some other. This\n\ntherefore suggests that there is still some lack of\n\nknowledge in this important aspect of web site\n\nconstruction.\n\nA pie menu (radial menu) is a type of menu\n\nwhich can be used for navigation purposes, e.g. on a web\n\nsite or application. Such a menu can have the same\n\nfunctionality as a linear menu. Further, a pie menu, with\n\ndegrees of variance, can be similar in appearance to a pie\n\nchart used in a typical spreadsheet application.\n\nIn this paper therefore, a brief consideration of\n\nsome of the main literature in the area is presented. Then\n\nan experiment the authors conducted is described along\n\nwith the results obtained. This is followed by some\n\nconclusions.\n\n2\\. KEY LITERATURE\n\nMost efforts in the research and development\n\ncommunity have concentrated on linear menus. Therefore\n\nthe amount of work that has been done in relation to pie\n\nmenus is limited when compared with the work done with\n\nlinear menus.\n\nIn a study by Kalbach and Bosenick \\[2\\]an\n\nevaluation was carried out for the development of the\n\nAudi Cars web site. They tested linear menus on the left\n\nand right sides of the web pages of the Audi web site.\n\nThey found that there was no significant\n\ndifference in terms of task times between the two menu\n\ntypes. However they did not test out any other metrics,\n\nwhich could have led to some interesting information.\n\nIn contrast a study \\[3\\] carried out byone of the\n\nauthors of this paper indicates that measuring other\n\nmetrics can give other interesting and useful information.\n\nIn the study by Murano and Lomas \\[3\\], four\n\nlinear menu positions (top, bottom, left and right of a\n\npage) were evaluated in the context of an online store.\n\nThe results showed in agreement with Kalback and\n\nBosenick \\[2\\] that tasks times did not seem to be affected.\n\nHowever in the Murano and Lomas \\[3\\] study\n\nerrors and mouse clicks were recorded along with final\n\nparticipant subjective opinions. The results showed that\n\nthe top horizontal and left vertical positioned menus\n\nincurred fewer errors and fewer mouse clicks. Further,\n\n1\n\npietro.murano@hioa.no, 2\n\nI.N.Khan@edu.salford.ac.u\n\nk\n\nVol. 6, No. 9, September 2015  ISSN 2079-8407\n\nJournal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences\n\n©2009-2015 CIS Journal. All rights reserved.\n\nhttp://www.cisjournal.org\n\n477\n\nparticipants’ levels of satisfaction were in line with the\n\nefficiency aspects observed in the study.\n\nThe issues of task time seem to be in agreement\n\nwith Faulkner and Hayton \\[4\\] too. They tested left and\n\nright positioned menus on a fictitious web site selling\n\nvarious goods to do with Christmas celebrations. They\n\nfound no significant differences in task times (in this case\n\nbuying something). However the study would have\n\nperhaps been much more rounded if other performance\n\nmetrics had been evaluated along with participant\n\nsatisfaction.\n\nHowever in some work done by McCarthy, Sasse\n\nand Riegelsberger \\[5\\] the position of menus was studied.\n\nTheir context was a commercial web site where they had\n\nsimple or complex versions. They evaluated left, top and\n\nright hand side menu positions. In recording tasks times,\n\nthese were significantly longer with the complex site\n\nversion. The three menu positions did not differ\n\nsignificantly when averaged across the tasks done and the\n\nsimple and complex sites. However there was better\n\nperformance with the left menu when users interacted\n\nwith the first page of the site. However, when users\n\ninteracted with the second page there were no differences\n\nfor performance.\n\nThe authors reasoned that users are able to adapt\n\nswiftly to other web page layouts, with performance not\n\nbeing affected negatively. However the impact of having\n\nreduced performance with the interaction of the first page\n\nis not clear and would need investigating further.\n\nAlthough more work has been carried out in the\n\ncontext of linear menus as described briefly above, the\n\nwork concerning pie menus is more limited, e.g. in Rubio\n\nand Janecek\\[6\\] some improvements to basic pie menus\n\nare described. They developed pie menus as contextual\n\nmenus to have transparency, the possibility for the user to\n\nmove the menu and a feature allowing the user to lock the\n\npie menu open and deploy several commands on one\n\nobject. This was in the context of a ‘graphical schema\n\neditor for modelling spatio-temporal databases’ \\[6\\]. The\n\nideas described in the paper are very interesting; however\n\nit would have been also interesting and useful if some\n\nevaluation of this design had been done.\n\nIn Samp and Decker \\[7\\] a comparison by means\n\nof an experiment was carried out with various versions of\n\npie menus and linear menus. Overall they found that\n\n‘visual search’ was faster with linear menus. However\n\nradial menus were found to be faster for pointing. The\n\nauthors tested some interesting aspects. The task they\n\ndesigned for users was for them to‘select a three word\n\nphrase of the form adjective-adjective-noun’ \\[7\\]. However\n\nit would have been good if the tasks used in the\n\nexperiment had a more realistic setting or better\n\necological validity.\n\nIn Bailly, Lecolinet and Nigay \\[8\\] flower menus\n\nare described and evaluated. Flower menus can be viewed\n\nas being related to pie menus because the options appear\n\nin a vaguely radial fashion on the screen. However their\n\nfunctionality somewhat differs from a typical pie menu.\n\nThese allow the use of mouse-based gestures in\n\noption selection. They also have an expert and novice\n\nmode available. The authors compared flower menus with\n\nlinear menus and polygon menus. Polygon menus are also\n\nlinked to radial menus where the selectable options are\n\ndisplayed in a more symmetrical fashion around a radial\n\ntype shape. Focusing on expert mode and learning, the\n\nauthors obtained results from an experiment to suggest\n\nthat flower and polygon menus were better for learning\n\nhow to use the expert mode. However flower menus were\n\nbetter for ‘activation’ and expert mode learning. The\n\nauthors conclude that flower menus are good for ‘large\n\nbreadth menus’ \\[8\\].\n\nThe menu concept and work carried out is\n\ninteresting. However it is felt that not enough is known\n\nabout how such a menu would fare in a real world\n\ncontext. This aspect would need evaluating further. Also\n\nflower menus do function in a different manner when\n\ncompared with a typical pie menu.\n\nThis brief review of the key literature indicates\n\nthat in some areas there is still knowledge lacking\n\nconcerning the usability of pie menus and indeed of linear\n\nmenus too. The sections that follow will now describe an\n\nexperiment and the results from the experiment conducted\n\nby the authors of this paper.\n\n3\\. MENU COMPARISON EXPERIMENT\n\n3.1 Hypothesis\n\nOur main key question regarding the useof pie\n\nmenus or linear menus is: Which of the two would be\n\nbetter in terms of user performance and user satisfaction?\n\nTo that end the following hypotheses were\n\ndevised to help focus the evaluation efforts:\n\nH1: The pie menu will befaster than the horizontal\n\nlinear menu for task time.\n\nH0: There will be no difference for task time between\n\nthe pie menu and the horizontal linear menu.\n\nH1: The pie menu will incur fewer errors than the\n\nhorizontal linear menu.\n\nH0: There will be no difference for errors between the\n\npie menu and the horizontal linear menu.\n\nH1: Participants will have more positive perceptions\n\nfor the pie menu compared to the horizontal\n\nlinear menu.\n\nH0: There will be no difference for participant\n\nperceptions between the pie menu and the\n\nhorizontal linear menu.\n\n3.2 Participants\n\nFor this study we wanted participants to be\n\nexperienced with computers and the internet. The main\n\nreasons for this requirement were to remove potential\n\nVol. 6, No. 9, September 2015  ISSN 2079-8407\n\nJournal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences\n\n©2009-2015 CIS Journal. All rights reserved.\n\nhttp://www.cisjournal.org\n\n478\n\nproblems of lack of basic knowledge with computers and\n\nthe internet in novices and to see the effects of the\n\nexperimental conditions on experienced users.\n\nIn order to try and discover prospective\n\nparticipants' experience levels we used a recruitment\n\nquestionnaire. We asked recruits to report the amountof\n\ntime they spent on the web and their experience with e-\n\ncommerce explicitly. It was decided that spending a large\n\namount of time on the web and remaining engaged in e-\n\ncommerce was taken to indicate expertise and\n\nengagement with the Web as a medium. On average,\n\nparticipants were expected to use the internet on a daily\n\nbasis or 20 hours per week or more.\n\nPotential participants' comfort levels with\n\ncomputer usage were also ascertained by means of the\n\nrecruitment questionnaire. We expected reported comfort\n\nlevels to be fairly high (3 points or more on a Likert-\n\ntype\\[9\\] scale of 5 points on the questionnaire). Further\n\nthere was the expectation that participants should be using\n\ncomputers for a wide range of purposes, preferably using\n\nthe internet for academic research, e-shopping, gaming\n\nand information gathering, e.g. job hunting and browsing\n\nthe news etc.\n\nLastly all participants had never used a pie menu\n\nin their computing usage experiences.\n\n3.3 Pilot Test\n\nPrior to conducting the experiment with the\n\nrecruited participants, a pilot test was conducted with two\n\nparticipants. They were selected after they met the desired\n\nrecruitment criteria. Observations from the pilot test were\n\nused to revise the method for carrying out the experiment\n\nwith the eventual real participants of the study.\n\nAt the end of the pilot test, the participants were\n\ngiven a post-experiment questionnaire to elicit their\n\nopinions about their performance, but they had difficulty\n\nin answering four questions which were specifically\n\nrelated to the tasks (see the Apparatus and Materials\n\nsection below for afull description of the tasks) as they\n\ncould not remember what had 'happened' in the four\n\ndifferent tasks. In these questions users had to mark\n\naLikert-type scale according to the level of ease they\n\nexperienced to accomplish the tasks.\n\nIn order to resolve this issue, in the actual\n\nexperiment it was decided to ask participants to complete\n\neach question relevant to each task immediately after\n\ncompleting a respective task.\n\n3.4 Design\n\nA within users design was used to execute the\n\nexperiment. This was chosen because a within users study\n\ncan help in reducing issues associated with individual\n\ndifferences. Hence, all the participants were exposed to\n\nboth menu designs.\n\nFurthermore, the within users design was applied\n\nby having half of the participants using the pie menu first\n\nand then the linear menu. The other half of the group of\n\nparticipants used the linear menu first and then the pie\n\nmenu. Random allocation was used to allocate\n\nparticipants to a particular ordering of menu use.\n\n3.5 Variables\n\nThe independent variables were the two menu\n\ntypes (pie and linear) and the type of tasks which involved\n\nfinding items/information on a specially developed\n\nprototype web site.\n\nThe dependent variables were the performance\n\nand the participants' subjective opinions.\n\nThe dependent measures were the overall task\n\ntime, the number of errors (i.e. errors occurred when the\n\nuser selected an incorrect menu item), and participants'\n\nsubjective opinions regarding various features of the web\n\nsite and the navigation used.\n\nThe perceptive opinions were elicited by means\n\nof a post-experiment questionnaire which covered detailed\n\naspects of the design of the basic web site, the navigation\n\nbar used and aspects of the participants' feelings during\n\nthe experiment. A Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5\n\nwas used for all the questions, where for all questions a 5\n\nscore was the highest possible positive score that could be\n\nallocated. The questionnaire covered the topics of ease of\n\nlearning, simplicity of the navigation and ease of use.\n\n3.6 Apparatus and Materials\n\nFor the experiment various items of apparatus\n\nand equipment were used. These were:\n\nAn HP laptop with the following main\n\nspecification:\n\noHP Pavilion dv6 Notebook PC,\n\noWindows Vista Home Premium 64-bit\n\nEnglish,\n\noIntel® CoreTM2 Duo CPU @ 2.00GHz,\n\no4 GB RAM,\n\no14.5” Screen.\n\nA stopwatch.\n\nA pre experiment questionnaire.\n\nA post experiment questionnaire.\n\nA consent form.\n\nThe tasks sheets containing four tasks for each\n\nmenu type.\n\nThe tasks were formulated to be performed at\n\nboth website versions separately. In each task participants\n\nwere required to find particular products having specific\n\ncharacteristics. For each menu type four different tasks\n\nwere devised. The tasks were equivalent to each other in\n\nterms of efficiency, difficulty, time taken to search menu\n\nitems and in terms of where the required items appeared\n\non the screen. This approach was used to minimize\n\nVol. 6, No. 9, September 2015  ISSN 2079-8407\n\nJournal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences\n\n©2009-2015 CIS Journal.

Two out of four tasks were\n\neasier as they belonged to the second level of the pie\n\nmenu while the remaining two tasks were comparatively\n\ndifficult belonging to the third level of the menu design.\n\nFurthermore, four different tasks were devised as\n\nfamiliarization tasks for the pie menu.\n\nTherefore the actual task list used is listed below:\n\nPie Menu Task list:\n\nTask1 - Find out the screen size of the “HTC\n\nRhyme” Mobile Phone.\n\nTask2 - Find out the processor speed of the\n\n“Apple IMAC MC309” Desktop Computer.\n\nTask3 \\- Find out the resolution of the “LG\n\nL1510M 15\"” LCD Flat Panel Monitor.\n\nTask4 - Find out how many print modes are\n\nsupported by the “Canon SELPHY CP710\n\nCompact Photo Printer”.\n\nLinear Menu Task list:\n\nTask1 \\- Find out the screen size of the “Apple\n\niMac MC510LL/A” Desktop Computer.\n\nTask2 - Find out the platform for the “HTC One\n\nV” Mobile phone.\n\nTask3 - Find out the aspect ratio of the “W2040T\n\n20-Inch 720p LCD” LG Monitor.\n\nTask4 \\- Find out the item width of “Canon\n\nPIXMA MP 210” Photo Printer.\n\nThe Pie Menu familiarization tasks are listed\n\nbelow (see next section for how these were used during\n\nthe experiment):\n\nTask 1- Please clicks on the ‘Bird’ menu item.\n\nTask 2 \\- Please find and click the ‘Ford’ menu\n\nitem under ‘Cars’ menu item.\n\nTask 3 - Please click the ‘Banana’ menu item.\n\nTask 4 - Please find and click the ‘Nandos’ menu\n\nitem under the ‘Fast-food’ menu item.\n\n4\\. PROCEDURE\n\nA sample of 16 participants was recruited\n\nencompassing students at a university. The experiment\n\nwas conducted in a project study room at the university.\n\nThe experimenter was in the same room as the\n\nparticipants. The room was quiet and private. The door\n\nwas kept closed to avoid distractions. Overall each session\n\nwith each participant lasted approximately 15 minutes.\n\nOnce a participant had arrived they were greeted\n\nand asked to be seated.Afterwards, a consent form was\n\nread and signed by the participant. The consent form\n\nspecified some details of the research and assured\n\nparticipants that there was no risk to them, that\n\nconfidentiality would be maintained, that their\n\nparticipation was voluntary and that they could terminate\n\ntheir participation at any time. Signing the consent form\n\nwas followed by filling out a pre-experiment\n\nquestionnaire. This questionnaire inquired about the\n\ndemographic information of participants as well as their\n\nexperience and comfort levels regarding computer and\n\ninternet usage.\n\nParticipants were then randomly assigned to one\n\nof the menu types (see Design section above for specific\n\ndetails)\n\nAt the start of each task, each participant was\n\nrequested to read aloud the task description from a printed\n\ncopy of the task list and then to begin the task. As each\n\nparticipant had no experience with pie menus, just before\n\nthe tasks were undertaken with the pie menu, the\n\nparticipants were given some familiarization tasks with a\n\npie menu. Then the real tasks were undertaken by each\n\nparticipant. The pie menu used in the familiarization stage\n\nwas different to the pie menu used in the actual\n\nexperiment. The functionality was similar, but the\n\nimagery and content were different.\n\nAfter completing the tasks with both websites, a\n\npost-experiment questionnaire was handed to participants\n\nto record their experiences. The questionnaire asked\n\nparticipants' opinions about ease of learning, simplicity of\n\nthe navigation and ease of use.\n\nDuring the experiment if a participant asked\n\nquestions regarding issues that arose which they felt were\n\nnot resolvable, with the hope of receiving hints from the\n\nexperimenter, a prepared response was given. To avoid\n\nany bias, the response to all the questions regarding help\n\nor hints to complete a task was: ‘Go ahead and give it a\n\ntry and I will note where it will take you’.\n\nAt the end of the experiment with the\n\nparticipants, each received a chocolate bar as a small\n\nremuneration for their participation.\n\n5\\. RESULTS\n\nAll the collected data was firstly explored with\n\nsummary statistics and examining the distributions and\n\noverall patterns. Complete results are not included here\n\nfor the purpose of brevity. However means and standard\n\ndeviations (SD) are included in Appendix 1.The initial\n\nexamination suggested that there was enough normality in\n\nthe data to use a parametric test. Therefore repeated\n\nmeasures one-way ANOVA was used.\n\nFor task times and errors, no significant\n\ndifferences were indicated by the ANOVA test and will\n\ntherefore not be discussed further in this section. These\n\nwere the only two performance aspects recorded in the\n\nexperiment.\n\nThe other data that was collected was of a\n\nsubjective nature and was elicited by means of a 10\n\nquestion post-experiment questionnaire using Likert-type\n\nscales. Each question was asked in relation to each menu\n\nVol. 6, No. 9, September 2015  ISSN 2079-8407\n\nJournal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences\n\n©2009-2015 CIS Journal. All rights reserved.\n\nhttp://www.cisjournal.org\n\n480\n\ntype. Therefore each question had two answers which\n\ncould then be compared.\n\nQuestion 1 asked users to rate how simply they\n\nfelt the navigation to be. Question 3 asked users to rate the\n\nease of learning for each menu. Question 9 asked users to\n\nrate how logical they felt the organisation of the menu and\n\nsub-menus to be. Question 10 asked users to rate how\n\nconfused they became during their interaction with the\n\nmenus. For all these questions, there were no statistically\n\nsignificant results. Therefore the actual ANOVA results\n\nare not presented here for brevity.\n\nHowever, for Question 2, there was a statistically\n\nsignificant result F(1,15) = 19.12, p<0.001. This asked\n\nusers to rate how pleasant they felt each menu to be in\n\nappearance. The pie menu was scored significantly higher\n\nthan the equivalent linear menu.\n\nFor Question 4, there was a statistically\n\nsignificant result F(1,15) = 5.45, p<0.034. This asked\n\nusers to rate their comfort levels whilst using each menu\n\ntype. The pie menu was scored significantly higher than\n\nthe equivalent linear menu.\n\nFor Question 5, there was a statistically\n\nsignificant result F(1,15) = 5.95, p<0.028. This question\n\nconcerned Task 1 and asked users to rate the ease of their\n\n'searching' for this task. The pie menu was scored\n\nsignificantly higher than the equivalent linear menu.\n\nFor Question 6, there was a statistically\n\nsignificant result F(1,15) = 5.95, p<0.028. This question\n\nconcerned Task 2 and asked users to rate the ease of their\n\n'searching' for this task. The pie menu was scored\n\nsignificantly higher than the equivalent linear menu.\n\nFor Question 7, there was a statistically\n\nsignificant result F 1,15) = 4.75, p<0.046. This question\n\nconcerned Task 3 and asked users to rate the ease of their\n\n'searching' for this task. The pie menu was scored\n\nsignificantly higher than the equivalent linear menu.\n\nFor Question 8, there was a statistically\n\nsignificant result F(1,15) = 6.36, p<0.023. This question\n\nconcerned Task 4 and asked users to rate the ease of their\n\n'searching' for this task. The pie menu was scored\n\nsignificantly higher than the equivalent linear menu.\n\n6\\. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nHaving statistically analysed the data collected\n\nduring the experiment, some interesting results were\n\nobtained. For performance no statistically significant\n\nresults were observed. For times and errors during the\n\ntasks, the data suggests that using a pie menu or linear\n\nmenu does not affect performance in terms of times and\n\nerrors. Positive hypotheses 1 and 2, which suggested that\n\nthe pie menu would perform better, are therefore rejected\n\non the basis of the above.\n\nHowever, the last positive hypothesis which\n\nsuggested that the pie menu would be 'preferred' is\n\naccepted, because the data for subjective opinions has a\n\nsubstantial amount of significant statistical results\n\nindicating the pie menu to have been perceived more\n\npositively than the linear menu.\n\nHowever, one of the potential issues that is\n\nunclear is whether the subjective opinions were as a result\n\nof seeing and interacting with something that was perhaps\n\nperceived at that moment in time as being new, different\n\nand maybe a fun activity. This question is not easily\n\nresolved and it would probably take a longer term study to\n\ninvestigate this matter. This would need to be done with\n\nsome software or a web sitethat is more fully developed\n\nand in the context of something more real that users could\n\nengage with on a regular basis. Preferences over time\n\ncould thus be elicited from a group of users. This can be\n\ndifficult to achieve because users would need some\n\npositive incentive to use such a systemover a period of\n\ntime and thus form more mature opinions.\n\nSome of the main previous studies involving pie\n\nmenus (or similar) have suggested a difference in\n\nperformance depending on menu type. Some studies also\n\nhad the common characteristic of having tasks that were\n\nnot of the kind used in real world situations whilst using a\n\ncomputer. The work described in this paper is advancing\n\nthis area, because firstly, the tasks designed for the\n\nexperiment were much more ‘real’ and therefore had more\n\necological validity. Secondly, the fact that our study\n\nsuggests no difference in performance with either menu\n\ntype, while other studies have shown some differences,\n\ncan indicate that there are still some issues to discover.\n\nFurthermore, this study and some of the other\n\nstudies may have the fault of using menus that are too\n\nsimple in nature. Perhaps future studies should ensure that\n\ndeeper levels of menus are tested. This may show some\n\ndifferences at deeper levels but not at higher levels and\n\nhaving this knowledge could be useful and interesting.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\\[1\\] Kelly, K.

Navigating a Web site efficiently and pleasurably is an important aspect that all Web designers and businesses should be concerned about. Some research has been carried out on Web navigation and menu structures (e.g., Murano and Sander, 2016;Murano and Khan, 2015;Murano and Lomas, 2015;Murano and Oenga, 2012). However, another aspect of navigation that requires more attention is navigating within a Web page by means of scrolling. ...\n\n[A usability evaluation of Web user interface scrolling types](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/339632118_A_usability_evaluation_of_Web_user_interface_scrolling_types)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Feb 2020\n\n- [Sushil Sharma](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Sushil-Sharma-2171388095)\n- [![Pietro Murano](https://c5.rgstatic.net/m/4671872220764/images/template/default/profile/profile_default_m.jpg)Pietro Murano](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pietro-Murano)\n\nThis paper details a usability evaluation of scrolling techniques on websites. The scrolling methods evaluated were normal scrolling (with default pagination), infinite scrolling, infinite scrolling with a ‘load more’ button and Infinite Scrolling with ‘pagination’. The four scrolling types were evaluated in the context of tasks that involved either serendipitous type tasks or goal-oriented type tasks. The evaluation was principally about the ‘raw’ performance and participant perceptions. This is because it was felt that the greatest gap in knowledge concerned these aspects. The evaluation was done by means of an experiment and the data collected was statistically analysed. The results were mixed in nature, where no single scrolling method stood out as being the most usable.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/339632118_A_usability_evaluation_of_Web_user_interface_scrolling_types)\n\nShow abstract\n\n... radial and flower menus.

The two principal suggestions concern trying to use more qualitative methods for investigating the issues and to develop in the future more universally designed menus.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/301945972_User_Interface_Menu_Design_Performance_and_User_Preferences_A_Review_and_Ways_Forward)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Breadth and orientation of pie menus for mid-air interaction: effects on upper extremity biomechanics, performance, and subjective assessment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/377786710_Breadth_and_orientation_of_pie_menus_for_mid-air_interaction_effects_on_upper_extremity_biomechanics_performance_and_subjective_assessment)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 2024\n\n- [Lujin Mao](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lujin-Mao-2191948333)\n- [Kenta Ono](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kenta-Ono-2205096122)\n- [Mengyao Qi](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mengyao-Qi-2191941221)\n- [![Makoto Watanabe](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/783257578790913-1563754567948_Q64/Makoto-Watanabe-9.jpg)Makoto Watanabe](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Makoto-Watanabe-9)\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/377786710_Breadth_and_orientation_of_pie_menus_for_mid-air_interaction_effects_on_upper_extremity_biomechanics_performance_and_subjective_assessment)\n\n[Comparison of Panel and Pie Menus for Mid-Air Interaction in a Photo Booth: Muscle Activity, Performance, and User Experience](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/375630251_Comparison_of_Panel_and_Pie_Menus_for_Mid-Air_Interaction_in_a_Photo_Booth_Muscle_Activity_Performance_and_User_Experience)\n\nArticle\n\n- Nov 2023\n\n- [Lujin Mao](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lujin-Mao-2191948333)\n- [Kenta Ono](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kenta-Ono-2205096122)\n- [Mengyao Qi](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mengyao-Qi-2191941221)\n- [Jinghua Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Jinghua-Huang-12505819)\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/375630251_Comparison_of_Panel_and_Pie_Menus_for_Mid-Air_Interaction_in_a_Photo_Booth_Muscle_Activity_Performance_and_User_Experience)\n\n[THE EVALUATION OF CASCADING AND RADIAL MENUS FOR AUGMENTED REALITY IN A SMARTPHONE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/355085331_THE_EVALUATION_OF_CASCADING_AND_RADIAL_MENUS_FOR_AUGMENTED_REALITY_IN_A_SMARTPHONE)\n\nArticle\n\n- Aug 2021\n\n- [Wan Mohd Abrar](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Wan-Mohd-Abrar-2202936956)\n- [![Hew Sh](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/279472096989184-1443642748069_Q64/Hew-Sh.jpg)Hew Sh](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hew-Sh)\n- [Wong Chee Onn](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Wong-Chee-Onn-2043664894)\n\nThe article describes an evaluation of cascading menu and radial menu in augmented reality (AR) on a smartphone. To evaluate the menus, we measured time to finish the tasks (in seconds) and usability (learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction) using the System Usability Scale Questionnaire. Data obtained is then analyzed using paired-samples t-test with repeated measures and Wilcoxon signed-rank test to find the statistically significant difference. Overall results showed a preference for the cascading menu type over the radial menu in terms of usability, different from other studies. Statistically, a significant difference was found performance-wise, which indicates that participants are more familiar with cascading menus which contributes to better task time. However, the performance improved the more prolonged the participants got used to the menu when it comes to the radial menu. For errors rates, it is found that the radial menu is less error-prone than cascading menu. This evaluation can help interface designers decide whether they should use the cascading menu or radial menu when designing an interface for AR on a smartphone. The research looks into filling the evaluation gap on the radial and cascading menu, specifically in augmented reality on a smartphone. While other studies have studied and evaluated the cascading menu and radial menu in other environments, this research, on the other hand, tested and evaluated the menu in an augmented reality environment instead of the more traditional desktop environment.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/355085331_THE_EVALUATION_OF_CASCADING_AND_RADIAL_MENUS_FOR_AUGMENTED_REALITY_IN_A_SMARTPHONE)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Effects of Menu Organization and Visibility on Web Navigation for People with Dyslexia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/335446689_Effects_of_Menu_Organization_and_Visibility_on_Web_Navigation_for_People_with_Dyslexia)\n\nChapter\n\n- Aug 2019\n- Lect Notes Comput Sci\n\n- [![Helen L.

This study investigated the effects of two aspects of web navigation, menu organization and visibility on the eye gaze behaviour, performance and preferences of dyslexic and non-dyslexic participants. Participants undertook four tasks on a website with either unified or fragmented main menu organization and either static or dynamic submenus. Dyslexic participants had significantly longer menu scanpaths (i.e. looked at more menu items), due to looking at more different menu items and revisiting more items in comparison to non-dyslexic participants. They also had more fixations and longer dwell times on submenus than non-dyslexic participants. They were also slower to select their first menu item and complete tasks. However, the perceptions of the different menu presentations did not differ between the two participant groups, although all participants preferred the unified menu presentation to the fragmented. Directions for further research to deepen the understanding and implications of these results are discussed.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/335446689_Effects_of_Menu_Organization_and_Visibility_on_Web_Navigation_for_People_with_Dyslexia)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Menu Positioning on Web Pages.

While the idea and use of menus on web pages is not new, the authors feel there is not enough empirical evidence to help designers choose an appropriate menu position. We therefore present the design and results of an empirical experiment, investigating the usability of menu positioning on web pages. A four condition experiment was conducted by the authors. Each condition tested a different menu position. The menu positions tested were left vertical, right vertical, top horizontal and bottom horizontal. The context was a fictitious online store. The results, based on statistical analysis and statistically significant findings, suggest that the top horizontal and left vertical positioned menus incurred fewer errors and fewer mouse clicks. Furthermore, the user satisfaction ratings were in line with the efficiency aspects observed.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/275824433_Menu_Positioning_on_Web_Pages_Does_it_Matter)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Could I have the Menu Please?

One set of guidelines is based on user expectation of layout, the other on results from user testing with alternative layouts. To resolve this conflict we test whether placing the menu in an unexpected position has a negative impact on search performance. The results show that users rapidly adapt to an unexpected screen layout. We conclude that designers should not be inhibited in applying design recommendations that violate layout conventions as long as consistency is maintained within a site.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/228784071_Could_I_have_the_Menu_Please_An_Eye_Tracking_Study_of_Design_Conventions)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[When Left Might Not Be Right](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/228833497_When_Left_Might_Not_Be_Right)\n\nArticle\n\n- Sep 2011\n\n- [Xristine Faulkner](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Xristine-Faulkner-81777462)\n- [![Clive Hayton](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Clive Hayton](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clive-Hayton)\n- [Principal Lecturer](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Principal-Lecturer-81751755)\n\nThis paper describes an experiment that was carried out on the positioning of menus (or navigational panels) on a Web site. A student cohort developed a Web site that sold Christmas trees, pots, and decorations. Two versions of the same Web site were produced—one with menus on the left and the other with menus on the right. In every other way the two sites were identical. Participants were asked to use one version of the Web site. After they used the Web site, they answered a short online questionnaire. They were unaware of the existence of the alternative version of the site. The findings showed that there was very little difference in the time-to-buy performance of participants who saw either the left-hand or the right-hand version of the site. In conclusion, there was no significant time savings in sticking to the convention of placing menus on the left-hand side of a Web site, and there might be advantages to placing menus on the right side of a Web site.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/228833497_When_Left_Might_Not_Be_Right)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Supporting menu design with radial layouts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/220944987_Supporting_menu_design_with_radial_layouts)\n\nConference Paper\n\n- May 2010\n\n- [Krystian Samp](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Krystian-Samp-70125396)\n- [Stefan Decker](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Stefan-Decker-8738561)\n\nOne of the ways of decreasing selection times in displayed menus is through the use of radial layouts which shorten distances to the items and increase the item sizes. Previous work on radial menus does not demonstrate that radial layouts are beneficial for menu hierarchies. The paper focuses on this topic. We compare two main characteristics of radial and linear layouts: a) the time it takes to find an item (i.e. visual search time), b) the time it takes to navigate to an item (i.e. pointing time). We use objective and subjective measures, two menu sizes, three menu levels, one linear and three radial layout variations. We also present requirements and the Compact Radial Layout (CRL) design which supports menu hierarchies. We assess its performance for novice and expert users.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/220944987_Supporting_menu_design_with_radial_layouts)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[A Technique for Measurement of Attitudes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/200086112_A_Technique_for_Measurement_of_Attitudes)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 1932\n\n- [RA Likert](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/RA-Likert-66735921)\n\nThe project conceived in 1929 by Gardner Murphy and the writer aimed first to present a wide array of problems having to do with five major \"attitude areas\"--international relations, race relations, economic conflict, political conflict, and religion. The kind of questionnaire material falls into four classes: yes-no, multiple choice, propositions to be responded to by degrees of approval, and a series of brief newspaper narratives to be approved or disapproved in various degrees. The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale.

Sixty-four participants were divided equally into two groups and assigned to either the left- or the right-hand navigation test condition. Using a stopwatch, the time to complete each of five tasks was measured. The hypothesis that the left-hand navigation would perform significantly faster than the right-hand navigation was not supported. Instead, there was no significant difference in completion times between the two test conditions. This research questions the current leading Web design thought that the main navigation menu should be left justified.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/publication/31914731_Web_Page_Layout_A_Comparison_Between_Left-_and_Right-justified_Site_Navigation_Menus)\n\nShow abstract\n\nWeb Page Layout: A Comparison between Left and Right Justified Site Navigation Menus\n\n- Jan 2003\n- 245-256\n\n- K Kelly\n- P Murano\n- T J Lomas\n\nKelly, K.

THE CASTLE - DAY 1 1\nSpires and towers, an ancient sprawling castle. \nNow a familiar voice:\nTHE DOCTOR\n(V.O.)\nAs you come into this world, \nsomething else is also born. \nPulling back -\nWe are looking at the sunrise through a row of windows in an \nancient, stone wall.\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nYou begin your life and it begins a \njourney - towards you. \nTime lapse photography: as the sun moves in the sky, the \nsunbeams sweep round the room like searchlights...\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nIt moves slowly, but it never \nstops. \nNow: cutting round various different locations in this \nsprawling castle world... Colonnades, and chambers, and \nfountains, and libraries ... All in dusty ancient stone.\nMoving closer over details: in every room, mounted somewhere \non the wall is a Cog Unit - a mechanical fixture that looks \nlike it could move the whole wall. \nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nWherever you go, whatever path you \ntake, it will follow; never faster, \nnever slower, always coming. \nNow, tracking along a floor. Sprinkles of blood, streaks of \nit, like someone, terribly injured has been hauling \nthemselves along.\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nYou will run - it will walk. You \nwill rest - it will not. \nNow travelling along those corridors, picking out details.\nEvery now and then, incongruously, there is a television \nmonitor wired into the wall. Each of these is currently \nsnowed with interference. \nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nOne day you will linger in the same \nplace too long.  \n(MORE)\n(CONTINUED)DW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             1You will sit too still or sleep too \ndeep - and when, too late, you rise \nto go, you will notice a second \nshadow next to yours. Your life \nwill then be over.\nNow on close on a section of wall. On closer inspection, a \ndoor.\nA crunching, grinding sound - and the wall section slides \naway revealing -\nCUT TO:\nINT. TELEPORT CHAMBER/CASTLE - DAY 2 2\nA circular chamber of ancient, but active, technology. Brass \nand glass. Intricate mechanisms, spinning and ticking and \nglittering everywhere. Again, dotted around the walls and \nequipment, cogs, this time in gleaming brass.\nCloser on:\nThe ceiling spirals down in towards the centre of the room, \nlike a funnel. Beneath the base of the funnel, a circular \nglass cabinet, just big enough for a man to stand in. It \nlooks like what it is: a teleporter . \nOn the teleporter controls.\nThe hunched shadow falls over it -\n- a trembling, bloodied hand reaches for a lever -\nThe room shakes, shudders!\nOn the wall - the brass cogs start glowing.\nThe bloodied hand slams the lever and the hunched figure \nfalls, crashing to the floor.\nIn the glass cabinet, a glow is starting up - exactly like \nthe glow we saw as the Doctor dematerialised at the end of \nTrap Street.\nOn the walls - the cogs turning.\nThe floor - the bloodied hand, shaking with effort, is \nwriting letters in the dust.\nB\nNow cutting round various walls of the castle -\n- the cogs turning and turning -\n- faster and faster -\nBack to the bloodied hand, writing in the dust -CONTINUED: 1 1\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(CONTINUED)DW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             2BIR\nThe glow in the cabinet, stronger and stronger. Starting to \ntake familiar shape -\nThe cogs - faster and faster.\nOn the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines \nbut not the finished word.\nThe hand starts to glow. Spasms in pain - steaming now. In a \nmoment the hand crumbles to the barest outline of ash.\nOn the brass cogs. They all slam to a halt.\nCutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to \na halt.\nNow on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\nThe golden glow is resolving, refining -\n- now clearly, this is the Doctor. \nHe is frozen for a moment - \n- then convulses into life. Choking, spluttering. Slams \nagainst the glass of the cabinet, starts to register where he \nis.\nA moment to recover. \nNow he’s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the \ngleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\nA haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting, \nsickeningly.\nFLASHBACK: Clara’s death from Trap Street.\nThe Doctor: she’s dead, she’s gone. Nothing he can do. \nSo. To business.\nHe glances round. A studied show of indifference to his \nsurroundings. \nStraightens his coat. Composes himself. If anyone is \nobserving, he’s telling them he means business and he is not \nafraid.\nFinally, he speaks. \nTHE DOCTOR\nIf you think, because she’s dead, I \nam weak, you understand very \nlittle. If you were any part of \nkilling her, and you are not \nafraid, you understand nothing at \nall. So for your own sake, \nunderstand this. I’m the Doctor.

And I will \nnever, ever stop. \nHe moves to the door - stops. What’s he walking in? He \nkneels. The floor seems covered in some strange ashy \nsubstance - almost as if the floor itself were made of a \ncompacted version of it. It clearly piles up in the corners. \nHe runs the dust through his fingers. What is that? Doesn’t \nmatter. He dusts it from his hands, steps to the door. It \ngrinds open. \nHe steps out into:\nCUT TO:\nINT. CIRCULAR CORRIDOR - DAY 3 3\nA corridor encircles the circular chamber. Four corridors, at \nregular intervals, give off radially from this circle. They \nare labeled North, South, East and West. There are windows \ntoo. He’s clearly in a tower.\nThe Doctor steps to one of the windows.\nA very high tower - and encircled by another, much larger \nbuilding. Fifty feet away, a rearing gray cliff face of \nwindows. There are walkways connecting this tower to the \nsurrounding castle - these are the corridors we already saw.\nHe looks down. This building is huge, falls away into mist.\nHe looks up. The sky above is coppery - like a sunset.\nTHE DOCTOR\nThe equipment in that room is \nconsistent with an augmented, ultra \nlong range teleport. So I am not \nmore than a single light year from \nwhere I was and I am in the same \ntime zone. \n(Looks out the window)\nWhen the sun sets I’ll be able to \nestablish an exact position by the \nstars. Then you’ll have a choice. \nCome out and show yourself. Or keep \nhiding. Clara said I shouldn’t take \nrevenge. You should know, I don’t \nalways listen.\nHe notices something. Propped against the wall, a perfectly \nordinary garden spade. On the blade of it, there are traces \nof fresh soil. He rubs the soil between his fingers.\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\nOh, are you gardeners? Never liked \ngardening. What sort of person has \na power complex about flowers - \nit’s dictatorship for inadequates . \nOr to put it another way - it’s \ndictatorship.

I don’t even have a name, \nI’m automatically ahead.\nAs he turns, he notices something. \nWords inscribed on the wall behind him. Almost filling it, \nlike a page of writing.\nThe Doctor’s POV. \nPanning along the words, the first line reads:\nAs you come into this world\nOn the Doctor, reading those words, frowning. Behind him we \nsee one of the TV monitors flare into life.\nThe picture resolves into a POVshot of a corridor similar to \nthe one we are in.\nNow panning down the next line of words.\nsomething else is also born.\nOn the screen: the POVchanging.

Through the window we can see another \nwing of the same building, more windows.\nPanning down the next line:\nTowards you.\nOn the screen: a sudden, shaky zoom in on one of the windows. \nAnd we see the Doctor as he is right now! He’s caught in \nprofile, reading the words on the wall.\nSome instinct makes the Doctor turn -\n- and he sees his own image on the screen.\nWhat??\nHe quickly calculates which window he’s being filmed through, \nsteps towards it.CONTINUED: 3 3\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(CONTINUED)DW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             5We hold on the screen as the Doctor now appears fully at the \nwindow, staring right at the camera.\nThe Doctor’s POV.\nAt a window, directly opposite him, a slim, motionless white \nfigure is staring back at him. At this distance, no details. \nBut it seems slightly ghostly, flowing. As if veiled. (This \nfigure we will come to know as Veil.)\nThe Doctor glances between the screen and Veil - clearly the \nmonitor is showing the creature’s POV.\n- and now that POVshifts.\nThe Doctor looks back to the creature. It is gone from the \nwindow - \n- but then is visibly walking slowly past the next window -\n- the walk is odd. One lurching pace, a pause. Another pace, \nanother pause. Like one foot strides out, and the other \ndrags.\n- now walking past the next window -\nWhere’s it going?\nThe Doctor looks back to the words on the wall.\nPanning down them:\nWherever you go\nVeil passing another window.\nWhatever path you take\nAnother window, another lurch and pause ...\nIt will follow\nOn the Doctor’s face, looking back to Veil. It passes out of \nsight -\n- and now starts along one of the walkway corridors leading \nto the circular chamber he is standing in.\nThe Doctor moves to the mouth of that corridor, looks along \nit -\n- we let him go, panning to the monitor on the wall.\nThe screen still shows Veil’s POV, now lurching and stopping \ndown the long corridor leading to the circular chamber. At \nthe end of the corridor we now see the Doctor come into view, \na distant, staring figure.\nWe close on the screen - low res on the Doctor’s face, slowly \ngrowing in size as the lurching thing approaches.

As it \napproaches we hear a droning hum, as if of millions of \ninsects.\nThe shadow stops for a moment - as if uncertain what to do.\nOn the Doctor. He’s round the other side of the circular \ncorridor - the central hub, containing the teleport chamber, \nseparates and conceals him from his pursuer.\nHis eyes are on:\nThe Doctor’s POV. A monitor on the wall -\n- Veil’s POV, looking one way and the other. And now moving, \nround the hub, towards the Doctor. \nLurch-pause. Lurch-pause.\nThe Doctor, moving too.

It was first broadcast on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One \"BBC One\") on 28 November 2015.

It was watched by 6.19 million viewers in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Heaven Sent\" received universal acclaim, with praise for Capaldi's performance, Moffat's script, and Talalay's direction.

It was nominated for the [Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation \"Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation\"). The episode was voted the best _Doctor Who_ story ever by readers of _[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine \"Doctor Who Magazine\")_ in 2023.\n\n## Plot\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Plot\")\\]\n\nThe [Twelfth Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Doctor \"Twelfth Doctor\") is teleported into a glass chamber within an empty castle in the sea. He is pursued by a cloaked veiled figure,[\\[N 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-1) which evokes the Doctor's childhood fears. When the figure corners the Doctor, he admits he is afraid to die. The figure halts and the castle reconfigures itself. The Doctor jumps out of a window into the sea, finding many skulls under the water. The Doctor concludes that the castle is a torture chamber. He takes advantage of the figure's slow reaction time to explore the castle, finding several strange remnants of his predecessors, such as dry replacement clothes, a skull connected to the transportation chamber, and the word \"bird\" written in dust. The Doctor investigates clues left in the castle, directing him to find Room 12. He delays the figure by alleging knowledge of \"the Hybrid\"; the movement of the reconfiguring castle causes the skull to fall into the sea.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Doctor_Who_Experience_%2830855119501%29.jpg/500px-Doctor_Who_Experience_%2830855119501%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Doctor_Who_Experience_(30855119501).jpg) The shrouded figure, referred to as the \"Veil\" in the credits, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.\n\nInside Room 12, the Doctor discovers a wall of Azbantium; a mineral harder than diamond, behind which he theorises the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS \"TARDIS\") to be. He realises that \"bird\" refers to \" [The Shepherd Boy](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_Household_Tales,_Volume_2/The_Shepherd_Boy \"s:Grimm's Household Tales, Volume 2/The Shepherd Boy\")\", a fairytale by the [Brothers Grimm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm \"Brothers Grimm\") in which a shepherd's boy says to an Emperor that a second of eternity will have passed when a bird chisels a diamond mountain down to nothing with its beak. The Doctor temporarily despairs following an epiphany: the prison was made solely for him, and thus the skulls were his own and he has been in the castle for 7000 years. Revitalised by a vision of his dead [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who) \"Companion (Doctor Who)\"), [Clara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Oswald \"Clara Oswald\"), the Doctor punches the wall while reciting the fable. The figure mortally injures the Doctor, disabling his [regeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who) \"Regeneration (Doctor Who)\"). He crawls back to the teleportation chamber, and burns his body as a catalyst to restart the teleport, aware that due to the resetting rooms, a \"blueprint\" of himself is inside. He then falls to the ground, writes \"bird\" in the dust, and disintegrates, reduced to the skull which the Doctor had seen earlier. A new Doctor appears, starting the cycle anew.\n\nAfter many more cycles,[\\[N 2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-2) the Doctor finally breaks through the wall. He finds himself outside the Capitol on [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey \"Gallifrey\"); the castle was in his confession dial.[\\[N 3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-3) The Doctor tells a young boy to tell the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord \"Time Lord\") that he is on his way and that he knows what they did.

He always knows there's a way to survive\".[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-bbc.co.uk-7)\n\nThe Doctor confesses that he ran from Gallifrey because he was scared, and that the pretense of being bored was a lie. Originally, in _[The War Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Games \"The War Games\")_ (1969), the [Second Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Doctor \"Second Doctor\") admitted to his [companions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who) \"Companion (Doctor Who)\") that \"Well, I was bored\".[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-bbc.co.uk-7)\n\nOnce he arrives on Gallifrey, the Doctor tells the young boy to announce that he \"came the long way around\", finally finishing the objective set by the Eleventh Doctor in \" [The Day of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor \"The Day of the Doctor\")\" (2013) saying that he was going \"home, the long way around\".[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-bbc.co.uk-7)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-8)\n\n## Production\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Production\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Doctor_Who_Experience_%2829349401791%29.jpg/500px-Doctor_Who_Experience_%2829349401791%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Doctor_Who_Experience_(29349401791).jpg) The teleporter set, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.\n\nThis episode primarily features the Doctor, with the non-speaking Veil portrayed by movement artist [Jami Reid-Quarrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jami_Reid-Quarrell \"Jami Reid-Quarrell\") (who also appeared as Colony Sarff in \"The Magician's Apprentice\" / \"The Witch's Familiar\" earlier in the series).

Many instances of extremely high praise were aimed towards Steven Moffat's script, Rachel Talalay's direction, and Peter Capaldi's performance.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-auto-26)[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-auto1-27)[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-avclub-28) The episode has a score of 89% on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), with an average score of 9.8, the highest average score of the series on the website. The site's consensus reads \"Peter Capaldi turns in a one-man command performance in this episode's exploration of grief, and a surprise turn of events sets up an explosive season finale\".[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-29)\n\nPatrick Mulkern of _[Radio Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Times \"Radio Times\")_ awarded the episode a perfect five star rating, saying that \"Peter Capaldi's one-man show is an instant classic\" and a \"tour de force\" for his magnificent performance. He also said that the episode's structure \"works perfectly without ever seeming contrived\" with Moffat's \"trademark intricacy\", and that Talalay \"steeps the production in atmosphere and sustains the momentum right until the final revelations\".[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-auto1-27)\n\nCalling the episode a \"mind-bending masterpiece\", Morgan Jeffery of [Digital Spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Spy \"Digital Spy\") stated that it was also \"one of the most surreal episodes to date\" with Moffat \"cleverly subverting the expectations of a low-budget escapade, with a surplus of Capaldi awkwardly expressing his inner thoughts aloud.\" He said that the episode was \"as far from big, broad, family-friendly entertainment as you can get\", and that and \"its rejection of the standard Doctor Who trappings might be too much for some\"; but if viewers embrace the weirdness, then you'll end up captivated, calling it \"demanding and intelligent science-fiction, the likes of which BBC One should be commended for airing\".[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-30)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Peter_Capaldi_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/440px-Peter_Capaldi_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peter_Capaldi_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg) [Peter Capaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Capaldi \"Peter Capaldi\") received widespread critical acclaim for his performance in the episode.\n\nAlasdair Wilkins of [The A.V.

Club\") gave the episode an 'A', for the fifth time this season, writing \"This season has been a remarkable achievement for the show, and, pending next week's finale, it's got a real chance to go down as the best season of the revival, topping even Matt Smith's debut in season five. And hey, maybe \"Hell Bent\" will be the perfect capper to this season, or maybe it won't. But the genius of the construction of this season's endgame is that \"Hell Bent\" could be an unmitigated disaster and it still wouldn't really undo the genius of \"Heaven Sent\" or \"Face The Raven\" before it.\"[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-auto2-17)\n\nAwarding the episode a score of 9.5 and deeming it \"amazing\" and the highest of the series, Scott Collura of [IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") particularly praised the episode's conclusion by stating that \"the realization that the sea of skulls is actually a sea of Doctor skulls\" is a thrilling, brilliant twist, played beautifully with a \"gentle guitar-driven score. He further praised Capaldi's performance, calling it \"a breathtaking one-man show\".[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-31) Referring to it as \"an epic one man show\", Tim Liew of _[Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper) \"Metro (British newspaper)\")_ also acclaimed the episode, saying that he \"loved it\". He particularly praised Steven Moffat and Peter Capaldi, stating that Moffat \"takes a bold step by stripping his story back to its bare bones\" and Capaldi \"delivers 100%, carrying every scene\"; he also praised the \"superb new musical score\" from series composer Murray Gold.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-auto-26)\n\nMark Rozeman of _[Paste Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paste_Magazine \"Paste Magazine\")_ also awarded the episode a perfect score (10.0), labeling it \"a masterpiece of the highest order\", whilst Ian Berriman of _[SFX Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFX_Magazine \"SFX Magazine\")_ also awarded full marks, saying \"Heaven Sent stands as the best episode of the season so far: madly surreal, ingeniously baffling, immensely creepy and downright gruelling in its latter stages, with a tremendously impactful payoff\".[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-pastemagazine.com-20)[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-ianberriman-23)\n\n### Accolades\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Accolades\")\\]\n\nIn 2016 \"Heaven Sent\" received a nomination for [Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation#Short_Form \"Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation\").[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who)#cite_note-32) \"Heaven Sent\" is also the first episode of _Doctor Who_ to be submitted for nomination for a [Primetime Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award \"Primetime Emmy Award\"), due to [BBC America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_America \"BBC America\") being one of the series' co-producers.

She began her career rooted in Argentine folk music and became a prominent figure in the El nuevo cancionero movement, giving a voice to many Latin American songwriters. \n   - Her music earned her nicknames such as \"voice of the voiceless ones\" and \"the conscience of Latin America\". Sosa's performances spanned major venues like New York's Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, Paris's Théâtre Mogador, and even the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.\n   - Across her career, she received numerous accolades including six Latin Grammy awards and was a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. \n   - Politically, Sosa was associated with leftist causes, opposing oppressive regimes and supporting the return of democracy in Argentina. Her arrest during Argentina's military dictatorship led to her temporary exile to Europe.\n   - Sosa's artistry and activism left a significant legacy, and she remains celebrated posthumously, including through accolades like posthumous Grammy wins and tributes such as a Google Doodle in 2019. \n\nFor more detailed reading, you can visit the Wikipedia page directly through the provided URL."

Sosa faced death threats against both her and her family, but refused for many years to leave the country. At a concert in [La Plata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Plata \"La Plata\") in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with all those attending the concert.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-Latin_artist_Mercedes_Sosa_dies-10) Their release came about through international intervention.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-8) Despite attempts to hold more concerts, she was officially barred from performing by the military regime.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-:0-5) Banned in her own country, she moved to Paris and then to [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid \"Madrid\").[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-8)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-Latin_artist_Mercedes_Sosa_dies-10)She has spoken publicly about her artistic and emotional struggles during this period of her life.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-:0-5) While in exile, she released the album _A Quien Doy_ in 1981. The album included a recording of the song \"Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pais\" which was originally written by the prolific Chilean singer/songwriter, [Patricio Manns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricio_Manns \"Patricio Manns\"). The song, which he wrote while also in political exile, expresses the sorrow he felt from being separated from his homeland.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#cite_note-16) She related to this feeling and struggled to continue recording and performing. In an interview with the New York Times, she said, “It was a mental problem, a problem of morale...It wasn’t my throat, or anything physical\".

Supporters of the cause expressed their sentiments in a music-hall ditty with this refrain:\n\n> We don't want to fight, yet by jingo if we do,\n>\n> We've got the ships, we've got the men,\n>\n> We've got the money, too!\n\nSomeone holding the attitude implied in the song became known as a _jingo_ or _jingoist_, and the attitude itself was dubbed _jingoism_. The _jingo_ in the tune is probably a euphemism for _Jesus_.\n\n* * *\n\n## Test Your Vocabulary with M-W

One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?Please decompose the task into several sub-tasks and find the answer step-by-step.",

AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and (moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Comments: | In proceedings of AAAI/ACM Conference AIES 2022 ( [this https URL](https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534158))

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen.\n\n|     |

        "assistant": "Solution: Based on the syntax and processing rules of Unlambda, there are several important aspects that we must consider to correct the code:\n\n1. **Prefix Operator `**:\n   - In Unlambda, the ` prefix operator is used to apply a function to an argument. If `f` and `x` are expressions, then `` `fx `` is an expression applying `f` to the argument `x`. \n\n2. **Combinators**:\n   - Various combinators are used in Unlambda such as `s`, `k`, `i`, `v`, and reading functions like `@`, `?x`, and `|`.\n   - `.x` is used for printing the character `x`, with side effects if any function is applied to it.\n   - `r` represents a new line character.\n\n3. **Output Requirement**:\n   - To output \"For penguins\", your code must have combinators in place to print character sequences correctly and handle outputs correctly with `.x`.\n\n4. **Current Code Analysis (`r```````````.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.si`)**:\n   - This code structure already includes `.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.s` which should print \"For penguins\".\n   - However, due to Unlambda's strict function application rules, improperly ordered expressions or missing application markers (` ` `) can lead to the code not executing as intended.\n\n5. **Adding Characters**:\n   - Given the prefix operator nature to apply functions in Unlambda, each character represented as `.x` should correctly link back to a function application structure ` ` `.\n   - `i` serves as the identity that may handle leftover expressions that need to be evaluated right away without effect.\n\nThe missing or incorrect aspect to modify in the code appears to be related to handling order of evaluation or posing identity via combinators to ensure that all functions `.x` relating to character outputs are addressed correctly. Also, it appears to potentially be missing a combinator `i` for correct execution since the printing seems stuck after \"For penguinsi\".\n\nThe task requirements hint at the need for a specific character to correct the code.

Instead, the `` ` `` prefix operator is used to apply a function to an argument; if _f_ and _x_ are expressions, then `` `fx`` is an expression that applies _f_ to the argument _x_. Other than this operator, every other element of the language is essentially a _combinator_, denoting a function taking exactly one other function as argument and returning another.\n\nFor example, the combinator `S I I (S I I)`, which reduces to itself, could be encoded with the following Unlambda expression:\n\n````\n```sii``sii\n\n````\n\n## Combinators\n\nThe following combinators are defined:\n\n**s** takes three arguments (via currying) and applies each of the first two to the third and applies those to each other and returns the result, that is, \\`\\`\\`sxyz evaluates to \\`\\`xz\\`yz.\n\n**k** takes two arguments (via currying) and returns the first.\n\n**i** takes one argument and returns it.\n\n**v** takes one argument and returns v.\n\n**.x** (where x is any character) takes one argument and returns it, with the \"side effect\" of printing x.\n\n**r** is an abbreviation for . _newline_.\n\n**d** as a function simply takes two arguments and applies the first to the second, but in an expression it has a special effect: the second argument must be evaluated before the first. While d has only one argument, that argument is not evaluated. (For example, \\`\\`d\\`.xi\\`.yi evaluates \\`.yi _first_, outputting y and returning i. Now since the second argument has been evaluated, d acts like the identity function i, so we have \\`\\`i\\`.xii, which evaluates to i and outputs x: the whole program outputs yx rather than xy due to d's special order-of-evaluation rules.)\n\n**c** takes one argument. When applied, c creates a continuation out of the program's current state and applies the argument to this continuation.\n\nA continuation is a special function that, when applied to an argument, \"goes back in time\" to when the continuation was created and makes the c function that created it return the continuation's argument instead of what it normally would. An example:\n\n```\n``cii     (This function creates a continuation (`*i). See meta-notation below.)\n``i(`*i)i (Now the function i is being applied to the continuation.)\n`(`*i)i   (i returns (`*i) as normal.)\n          (Applying (`*i) takes us \"back in time\"...)\n`ii       (...and changes the original `ci to the argument that (`*i) was applied to, which is i.)\ni         (`ii is evaluated, returning i as normal.)\n\n```\n\nThe following combinators were added in Unlambda version 2:\n\n**e** takes one argument. When applied, e exits the program, possibly providing its argument as the program's result. Put another way, e is an abbreviation for a continuation, the one in which the whole program is run.\n\n**@** takes one argument. When applied, it tries to read a character of input, making it the _current character_. It then applies its argument to i if successful or to v if not (for example on EOF).\n\n**?x** takes one argument. When applied, it compares the current character to x, and then applies its argument to i if equal and to v if not (or if no character has been read, or EOF has been reached).\n\n**\\|** takes one argument. When applied, it applies its argument to .x, where x is the current character, or to v if no character has been read, or EOF has been reached.\n\n## Complexity class\n\nBecause Unlambda embeds the SKI basis, which embeds every lambda term, it is Turing-complete; in particular, it is undecidable whether a given Unlambda expression halts when evaluated or even whether it has a normal form.\n\n## Examples\n\nSeveral more examples are included in the Unlambda distribution.\n\n### Palindromes\n\nThis program is a palindromic [Hello, World](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hello,_world! \"Hello, world!\") program inspired by [this Stack Overflow thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20141011143701/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/659752/programming-challenge-can-you-code-a-hello-world-program-as-a-palindrome) _(from the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine \"wikipedia:Wayback Machine\"); retrieved on 11 October 2014)_:\n\n````````````````\n`.d`.c`.d`.c`.d`.c`.d``e\n`````````````.H.e.l.l.o.,. .W.o.r.l.dii```````````````iid.l.r.o.W. .,.o.l.l.e.H.`````````````\ne``d.`c.`d.`c.`d.`c.`d.`\n\n````````````````\n\nNote that this program triggers a bug in at least the C interpreter ( `e` doesn't actually exit as it should), so use another interpreter.\n\nInstead of using `e` to avoid applying the padding functions, we can use `d` plus the fact that applying a `?x` function to `v` has no effect:\n\n````````````````\n`?d`?c`?d`?c`?d`?c`?d``v````````````.H.e.l.l.o.,. .W.o.r.l.di`d\n```````````````\nd`id.l.r.o.W. .,.o.l.l.e.H.````````````v``d?`c?`d?`c?`d?`c?`d?`\n\n````````````````\n\nThe above also works in the C interpreter. Both of these methods can be used with a general program, as long as you avoid reverse syntax errors. The substitution of `[?.]x` with ``` ``k[?.]x.i``` can be used for this.\n\n### [Hello, world!](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hello,_world! \"Hello, world!\")\n\n```\n`.!`.d`.l`.r`.o`.w`. `.,`.o`.l`.l`.e`.Hi\n\n```\n\n### [Cat program](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cat_program \"Cat program\")\n\nA cat program similar to the infamous counter2 example from the distribution:\n\n```\n``cd``d`@|`cd\n\n```\n\nThat program is a bit inefficient, as it builds up some growing continuations and may need to test eof several times before actually halting. The following shouldn't have that problem:\n\n````\n```s`d`@|i`ci\n\n````\n\n### [Looping counter](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Looping_counter \"Looping counter\")\n\n```\n``ci`.*`c`.*r\n\n```\n\nwithout `c`\n\n`````\n````sii``s``s`ks``s``s`ks``s`k`s``s`k``s``si`k.*`kri``s`kki``s`kki`k``s`k``s`k`s``s`ks``s`kki``s``s`ks``s`k`s`ks``s`k`s`kk``s``s`ks``s`kki`ki`k`kiii\n\n`````\n\n### [Deadfish](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish \"Deadfish\") interpreter\n\nSee [Deadfish#Unlambda](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish#Unlambda \"Deadfish\").\n\n### Number I/O\n\nThe following parses a space-terminated input of decimal digits as a Church numeral.\n\n`````\n``\n````sii                                                      # Actual parser\n``s`k `s`kc\n``s``s`ks ``s`k `s`ks ``s`k `s`kk\n    ``s`k `s`kd ``s`k `s`kk ``s``s`ks ``s``s`ks k k `k\n     `d ``s `k `s``s`ks ``s`kk                               # Add next digit\n      ` `?0`?1`?2`?3`?4`?5`?6`?7`?8`?9                      # Parse one digit\n       ```sii                       # Calculate number from i and v arguments\n        ``s`k `s`kc\n         ``s``s`ks ``s`kk ``s`ks ``s`kk  ``s`kd ``s`kk ``sii  `k ``s s `k`k `\n          ```sii                                  # Count v arguments until i\n           ``s`k `s`k `s`k c\n            ``s``s`ks ``s`k `s`ks ``s`k `s`kk ``s`k `s`ks ``s`k `s`kk\n             ``s`k `s`kd ``s`k `s`kk  ``s``s`ks ``s``s`ks k k  `k `s``s`ks k\n            `k ``s`k `s s ``s`kk k\n          `ki                                               # Initial count 0\n       i                                  # Final i argument to stop counting\n      `s`k                                                   # Multiply by 10\n       ``s``s`ksk ` ``s``s`kski ``s``s`ksk ``s``s`kski\n    `k ``s`d`k `s `@ ?  k                                     # Stop on space\n`ki                                                      # Initial number 0\n.*i                                             # Test by printing asterisks\n\n`````\n\nThe following (taken from the Deadfish interpreter) prints out a Church numeral in decimal.\n\n````\n`\n``s`k                                    # Actual printing function\n```sii ``s `k `s``s``si\n`k ``s``s``si`kk\n       ``s`k`s``si`k\n        `k``si`k `k``si`k `k``si`k `k``si`k `k``si`k\n         `k``si`k `k``si`k `k``si`k `k``si`k k\n        ``s`kk ``s``s`ks``s`k`s`ks ``s`k`s`kk ``si`k`ki `ki\n       ``s`k`s``s`ks``s`k`sik ``s`kk``s`kk``si`k`ki\n`ki ``s`kk\n    ``s``s`ks ``s`k`s`ks ``s`k`s`kk\n     `k ``s``si`k.9 `k ``s``si`k.8 `k ``s``si`k.7 `k ``s``si`k.6 `k\n         ``s``si`k.5 `k ``s``si`k.4 `k ``s``si`k.3 `k ``s``si`k.2 `k\n         ``s``si`k.1 `k `k.0\n     ``s`kk\n      ``s``s`ks``s``s`ks\n       `k ``s`kc ``s`k`s`k`k`ki ``s``s`ks``s``s`ksk `k`k``si`ki `kk\n       ``s``s`kskk `ki\n``s `k`s``s`ks k i\n``s``s`ksk ` ``s``s`kski ``s``s`ksk ``s``s`kski   # Testing with 10\n\n````\n\n## Meta-notation\n\nFor reasoning about Unlambda programs, or for displaying partially evaluated expressions, it is useful to have a notation for ongoing computations and continuations. These suggestions are not part of the language proper, but can be added to debugging implementations.\n\n- To denote a continuation, write an expression in parentheses, with a \\* character at the spot where a value may be returned.\n\nIf the continuation is applied to an argument, that argument is substituted for the \\*, and the resulting expression in parentheses replaces the whole program.\n\nUsing the e combinator and considering \\* as a variable, this notation may be taken as an abbreviation for a lambda expression: ( _expression_) = ^\\*\\`e _expression_. Alternatively, it may be considered an \"inside-out\" printing of the actual continuation structure used by some implementations.\n\nIn order for a continuation to have the intended meaning, the \\* should be at a spot in the expression where the next evaluation may take place, that is, everything before it should have been already evaluated, and it should not be inside a promise ('d _expression_).\nThere might be more than one \\* in a continuation, but only one is not nested in further parentheses (representing embedded continuations).\n\n- To distinguish between expressions and already evaluated functions, use a different notation for the latter, replacing the \\` character by ' (a forward quote).\n\nAn evaluated function will then not contain \\` except after a 'd (because d \"freezes\" unevaluated expressions) or inside an embedded continuation.\n\n- To shorten notation or to make structure sharing explicit, define names for common subexpressions.\n\nWe borrow the $v notation from the unlambdaifier tool, and let $v= _expression_ or _function_. The assignment may be listed separately or for example embedded in the expression at the first spot where the subexpression is used. To embed continuation variables in this way we may use an inside-out notation such as (=$x:...) for definition and ($x:...) for referencing.\n\nA shorter notation for inside-out continuation variables is to use other types of brackets, such as \\[...\\] or <...>.\n\n- Using these notations it is possible to evaluate Unlambda programs in an equational style. If you wish to substitute such equations into expressions, note that instances of the (...) notation in the equation also need to be substituted by the continuation of the subexpression.\n\nFor example, the equation \\`cc = (\\*) is valid. When substituting this into \\`c\\`cc, we must also substitute (\\`c\\*) for (\\*), giving \\`c\\`cc = \\`c(\\`c\\*). Note that we can only do this for subexpressions that are next in order for evaluation, at a spot where a \\* would be allowed. This restriction does not apply for equations that do not contain the (...) notation.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Subtle cough](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Subtle_cough \"Subtle cough\")\n- [Iota](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Iota \"Iota\"), [Jot](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Jot \"Jot\"), and [Zot](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zot \"Zot\")\n- [Lazy K](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Lazy_K \"Lazy K\")\n- [S and K Turing-completeness proof](https://esolangs.org/wiki/S_and_K_Turing-completeness_proof \"S and K Turing-completeness proof\")\n- [Savage Operator](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Savage_Operator \"Savage Operator\")\n\n## External resources\n\n- [The Unlambda Programming Language](http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/) (official website)\n- [The Comprehensive Unlambda Archive Network](ftp://ftp.madore.org/pub/madore/unlambda/CUAN/), a collection of Unlambda programs\n- [Unlambda resources](http://oerjan.nvg.org/esoteric/) by [Ørjan Johansen](https://esolangs.org/wiki/%C3%98rjan_Johansen \"Ørjan Johansen\")\n- [Unlambda in K](http://www.nsl.com/papers/unlambda.htm) by Stevan Apter\n- [A slow Unlambda interpreter in PHP](http://zzo38computer.org/esoteric/unlambda/slow_unlambda_php.zip) and [a combinator calculator and partial Unlambda interpreter](http://zzo38computer.org/combinator.htm) by [User:Zzo38](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Zzo38 \"User:Zzo38\") (see also: [Combinator birds](http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/cus/combinator/birds.html))\n- [IOCCC winner entry 2019/adamovsky that is an obfuscated interpreter for Unlambda](http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2019_adamovsky) ( [program C source code](http://www.ioccc.org/2019/adamovsky/prog.c), [Makefile](http://www.ioccc.org/2019/adamovsky/Makefile), [docs](http://www.ioccc.org/2019/adamovsky/hint.text))\n- [David names Unlambda as one of his “main contributions toward obfuscation in computer science”](https://twitter.com/gro_tsen/status/1364661715300933633)\n\nRetrieved from \" [https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Unlambda&oldid=154977](https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Unlambda&oldid=154977)\"\n\n[Categories](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Special:Categories \"Special:Categories\"):\n\n- [Languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Languages \"Category:Languages\")\n- [Turing tarpits](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Turing_tarpits \"Category:Turing tarpits\")\n- [Turing complete](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Turing_complete \"Category:Turing complete\")\n- [Functional paradigm](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Functional_paradigm \"Category:Functional paradigm\")\n- [Implemented](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Implemented \"Category:Implemented\")\n- [1999](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:1999 \"Category:1999\")\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Search\n\n[Visit the main page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page \"Visit the main page\")"

Field plots planted with graft inoculated plants of virus-free cultivars Beauregard, Dimbuka, Ejumula, Kabode and NASPOT 1 were used to assess the effect of SPFMV and SPCSV on yield and quality of sweetpotatoes in two agro-ecologies. SPFMV spreads rapidly to control plots at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute Kabanyolo (MUARIK), and these plots had similar yields to those singly infected with SPFMV but at the National Semi Arid Resource Research Institute (NaSARRI) where SPFMV spreads slowly, plots infected with SPFMV yielded 40% less than the control. Recovery from SPFMV appeared to be more frequent at NaSARRI than at MUARIK. Infection by SPCSV alone resulted in yield losses of 14–52%, while mixed infections of SPFMV+SPCSV resulted in yield losses in both locations of 60–95% depending on the cultivar. SPCSV and mixed infections of SPFMV+SPCSV also reduced the number of roots formed as well as the diameter of the roots, resulting in a greater length to diameter ratio compared to the healthy control. This study, therefore, confirms that both SPFMV and SPCSV, both singly and when mixed, can reduce yield, the extent depending on the cultivar. To mitigate the effect of these viruses, farmers should use clean planting materials of resistant varieties.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSweetpotato is a vegetatively propagated crop, and systemic pathogens like viruses can persist and spread over successive crop cycles (Bryan et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0004)). Over 30 viruses belonging to potyvirus, crinivirus, carlavirus, cucumovirus, ipomovirus, badnavirus and begomovirus have been reported to infect sweetpotatoes worldwide (Mukasa et al. [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0025); Untiveros et al. [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0030); Valverde et al. [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0031); Clark et al. [2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0006)). Of these, only six have been reported in Uganda, namely _Sweet potato feathery mottle virus_ (SPFMV), _Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus_ (SPCSV), _Sweet potato chlorotic flecks virus_ (SPCFV), _Sweet potato collusive virus_ (SPCV), _Sweet potato mild mottle virus_ (SPMMV) and _Sweet potato leaf curl Uganda virus_ (SPLCUV) (Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012); Mukasa et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0024); Aritua et al. [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0003); Wasswa et al. [2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0033)). SPFMV and SPCSV are the most prevalent and when they co-infect, result in severe symptoms described as sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD) (Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012); Karyeija et al. [2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0018); Mukasa et al. [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0025)) causing up to 90% yield losses (Mukiibi [1977](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0026); Karyeija et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0017); Aritua et al. [2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0002)).\n\nDue to the severe yield losses caused by SPVD, most research in Africa including Uganda has concentrated on this, neglecting the occurrence as single infection with SPFMV and SPCSV. Plants affected by SPVD are easily recognizable by farmers due to the severe symptoms and may be controlled by combination of removal and not selecting them as planting material for the next crop (Aritua et al. [1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0001)). On the other hand, the impact of individual viruses which are usually symptomless and are therefore difficult for farmers to control has not been well studied. In addition, no field study has so far been carried out in Uganda to determine the effect of single virus infections on yield of sweetpotatoes. Studies in other countries on the effect of SPFMV on yield of sweetpotato cultivars are contradictory. Some studies have reported no effects on yield of storage roots and vines in comparison with healthy plants (Milgram et al. [1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0022); Clark and Hoy [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0005)), and other studies have reported SPFMV-infected plants producing better yield than the healthy control (Gutierrez et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0013)), while others have reported yield reduction of up to 46% (Gibson et al. [1997](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0011); Mukasa [2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0023); Njeru et al. [2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0027); Domola et al. [2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0009)). Due to this contradictory evidence, there is a need to further investigate the effect of SPFMV on Ugandan sweetpotato cultivars to design an effective management system in Uganda.\n\nAlso, single infection of SPCSV may produce clear symptoms in some cultivars, but farmers can confuse its symptoms with purpling of mature leaves due to nutrient deficiencies in the soil or plant maturity (Gibson et al. [1997](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0011); Mukasa et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0024)). As a result, cuttings from such plants are used for subsequent propagation. Data on effects of single infection of SPCSV under field conditions in Uganda are also limited. However, SPCSV alone has been reported to cause a 30% yield reduction in cv Costanero, in Peru (Untiveros et al. [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0030)). In Uganda, a yield reduction of 50% in cv Tanzania under screenhouse conditions was reported although the yield performances of both healthy plants and infected ones were poor (Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012); Mukasa et al. [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0025)). Virus expression and its effect in plants is influenced by the environment, and hence, there is a need to determine the effect of virus under field conditions in contrasting agro-ecologies.\n\nContinued use of symptomless but infected cuttings by farmers in Uganda could also be a reason why the potential average yield has not been achieved. This study therefore aimed to determine the effects of single infection of SPFMV or SPCSV and their combination on the yield of four sweetpotato cultivars grown in Uganda under field conditions of two agro-ecologies.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Virus testing\n\nThree leaf samples (leaf disc of ~1 cm diameter) per plant were picked from the top, middle and bottom part of the plants and ground in a polyvinyl bag using appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) extraction buffer (1 ml buffer per leaf disc). The leaf samples were tested either using NCM ELISA or DAS and TAS ELISA. Nitrocellulose membrane ELISA was carried out following the protocol obtained from CIP Lima, Peru to detect the presence of any of the ten viruses, that is SPFMV, SPMMV, _Sweet potato latent virus_ (SPLV), SPCFV, _Sweet potato mild speckling virus_ (SPMSV), C-6 virus, SPCSV, SPCV, _Sweet potato virus G_ (SPVG) and _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV) for which antibodies were available. The presence of virus was judged on the visual intensity of the colour change on the membrane. Additional tests using DAS and TAS ELISA were specifically carried out to detect and estimate the virus titre for SPFMV or SPCSV, respectively, using protocol by Clark and Adams ([1977](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0100)). The DAS-ELISA kit (containing coating antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG) and detecting antibody IgG-AP) against SPFMV and TAS ELISA kit containing (primary antibody, rabbit IgG, secondary mouse monoclonal antibody MAb and detection antibody, rabbit anti-mouse IgG-AP) against SPCSV and respective positive controls were from Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkuturen GmbH, Germany. The p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and microplates used were from Sigma Chemical Co. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm after one and half hours using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model 680).\n\n### Source of virus inoculum\n\nIsolates of SPFMV and SPCSV were sourced from farmers’ fields at Namulonge, Wakiso district. Cuttings were collected and graft inoculated onto the nearly universal indicator plant, _Ipomoea setosa,_ and left to grow to allow symptoms to express. The symptomatic plants were tested using nitro-cellulose membrane (NCM) ELISA for ten viruses for which the antibodies were available and those reacting positively for SPFMV and for SPCSV alone were selected and retested using DAS or TAS ELISA, respectively. SPCSV was maintained in cv Kampala white, SPFMV was maintained in cv Resisto, and mixed SPFMV + SPCSV was maintained in cultivar Ejumula in a screenhouse at MUARIK. The screenhouse was sprayed every 2 weeks with imidacloprid to kill aphids and whiteflies. The virus presence in these cultivars was continually checked by grafting to _I. setosa_ plant and by serology using DAS or TAS ELISA.\n\n### Sources of healthy planting material\n\nSymptomless sweetpotato cuttings of cvs. Beauregard, Dimbuka, NASPOT 1 and Ejumula were collected from sweetpotato fields at the National Crops Resource Research Institute (NaCRRI), Namulonge in Wakiso district, while cv. Kabode was obtained from farmers’ fields in Soroti district. They were grafted on plants of _I. setosa_. The grafted plants were monitored for the absence of virus symptoms for 5 weeks. Their virus-free status was further confirmed using NCM ELISA. Scions that tested negative for viruses here referred to as healthy scion were multiplied in plastic pots containing sterilized mixture of soil, sand and animal manure in equal proportions and left to grow in an insect proof screenhouse at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute Kabanyolo (MUARIK) in Wakiso district. The numbers of cuttings for field planting were increased through repeated two node cuttings. To ensure sustained availability of virus-free planting material, some of the materials were multiplied _in vitro_ at MUARIK.\n\n### Generation and multiplication of planting materials infected with viruses\n\nVirus-indexed sweetpotato cuttings of cvs Dimbuka, Ejumula, Kabode, NASPOT 1 and Beauregard of 30 cm length were potted and left to grow for 2 weeks in a screenhouse at MUARIK. Each cultivar was planted in 15 pots making a total of 75. The plants were divided into three groups, each having five cuttings per cultivar. One group was graft inoculated with SPFMV, another was graft inoculated with SPCSV, and third was graft inoculated with SPFMV+ SPCSV. These were left to grow while monitoring for symptoms. After 1 month, infection was confirmed using DAS (for SPFMV) and TAS ELISA (for SPCSV) and the cuttings were multiplied through making repeated two node cuttings to obtain enough planting material for the field experiment. The multiplied planting material was further tested by grafting on _I. setosa_ to confirm their infection status before planting in the field.\n\n### Field experiment\n\nFour field trials were conducted at MUARIK and at the National Semi Arid Resource Research Institute (NaSARRI) located in Serere district in eastern Uganda. In the first trial, the yield of SPFMV-infected sweetpotato was compared to that of virus-indexed material at both MUARIK and NaSARRI. In this trial, a split plot randomized block design was used in which the SPFMV-infected plants and healthy controls acted as the main plot (to minimize virus spread), while the cultivars acted as the subplots. Five cultivars, namely Kabode, NASPOT 1, Ejumula, Dimbuka and Beauregard, were evaluated. The experiment was replicated three times with each experimental block laid in an area of 5 by 10 m. Each treatment was planted in five mounds per plot, and each mound was made at spacing of 1 by 1 m and planted with three vine cuttings. In the second trial, a similar design was used except that an additional treatment of SPFMV-infected cuttings from the 1st trial was included in the 2nd trial in order to evaluate the cumulative exposure to virus infection on yield. Also in the 2nd trial, cv Beauregard was dropped and the remaining four cultivars were used in the study using the same design as above.\n\nIn the 3rd and 4th field trials, SPFMV, SPCSV and the combination of SPFMV+ SPCSV were evaluated. A randomized split plot design was used where the main blocks consisted of pathogen inoculum and the sub-blocks were the cultivars used. This was replicated three times. Four treatments all obtained from screenhouse were used, that is healthy controls, SPFMV, SPCSV and SPCSV+ SPFMV and the same cultivars except Beauregard. Systemic insecticide (imidacloprid locally known as Confidor) was applied monthly for field trials at MUARIK to control aphids and white flies. Weeding was performed 2–3 times depending on the weed intensity using a hand hoe.\n\n### Disease symptoms and yield measurement\n\nSweetpotato plants were monitored for virus symptom development, and severity data were collected at monthly interval beginning 1 month after planting for period of 4 months. A severity score of 1–5 was used, where 1 = plants showing no symptoms; 2 = virus symptoms just starting to appear and this can be as mild chlorotic spots on the older leaves or mild vein clearing or mild purpling at the leaf margin of mature leaf; 3 = the symptoms above enlarge and become more visible; 4 = infected plants showing severe disease symptoms including leaf purpling, leaf chlorosis and leaf shape starts to get distorted; and 5 = infected plants showing very severe virus disease symptoms including total distortion in leaf shape, stunted growth, mosaic, leaf chlorosis and sometimes complete death of infected plant (Hahn et al. [1981](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0014)). Harvesting was performed 5 months after planting. At harvest, total yield/mound, marketable yield, total root number, marketable root number, root diameter, root length and vine weights were determined. The root length and diameter were measured using a marked thread. For each sweetpotato storage root, the diameter was measured at three positions, at the neck end, the middle and the tail end and the average diameter recorded.\n\n### Evaluation of sweetpotato virus disease recovery and virus infection\n\nDetection of viruses that could have infected sweetpotato during the growing season in the 1st and 2nd field trials was carried out using NCM ELISA. Samples were collected from symptomatic leaves or a leaf from the basal, middle and upper parts of symptomless plants. At least 15 samples (five samples per plot) per cultivar per treatment of each trial were collected and tested for 10 viruses, that is SPFMV, SPMMV, SPLV, SPCFV, SPMSV, C-6, SPCSV, SPCV, SPVG and CMV which antibodies were available. Positive control samples for each virus were provided in the NCM ELISA Kit by CIP Lima, Peru. The plants were serologically evaluated at the end of each trial before harvesting. The presence of virus was confirmed visually based on the intensity of the colour change on the membrane. Also prior to harvesting, ten symptomless cuttings per cultivar from SPFMV-infected plants were graft inoculated on _I. setosa_ and monitored for any virus symptom for a period of 5 weeks. Any infected _I. setosa_ plants were further tested with NCM ELISA to confirm the viruses present.\n\n### SPFMV and SPCSV accumulation in different sweetpotato cultivars in two agro-ecologies\n\nThe virus quantification was carried out on the 3rd and 4th trial to determine the virus load of SPFMV and SPCSV in the field exposed materials in two agro-ecologies. DAS and TAS ELISA were used as described previously (Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012)) to estimate the virus titre.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out using Genstat 13th Edition. Data on virus severity, storage root yield, storage root quality and vine weight were subjected to analysis of variance, and the means separated using Fisher's protected least significant difference at 5% probability level.\n\n## Results\n\n### Symptom expression due to single or mixed infection by SPFMV and SPCSV under field conditions\n\nAnalysis of variance for disease severity indicated a significant (P ≤ 0.05) cultivar, virus and interaction between cultivar by virus effect on disease severity at both MUARIK and NaSARRI. Severity was observed to increase with time of field exposure in all the cultivars tested in both locations (Fig. [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0001)). Dual infection of SPFMV and SPCSV caused the most severe symptoms in all the cultivars in both locations including vein chlorosis, purple spots on the leaf, mosaic, distorted leaf shape and stunted plant growth (Fig. [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0002) h, i, j and k). This is followed by single infection of SPCSV (Fig. [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0001)) in which the common symptoms were chlorotic spots, purple/reddish spots on mature leaves and leaf chlorosis (Fig. [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0002) d–g). Disease severity due to SPFMV alone was generally low in all cultivars in both locations. The symptom expression due to SPFMV was characterized by mild chlorotic spots and mild vein clearing in some cultivars (Fig. [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0002) a–c). Virus-indexed healthy control materials at MUARIK displayed greater disease severity scores than SPFMV-infected plants (Fig. [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0001) a, c, e and g). At NaSARRI, all the control plants had the least disease severity compared to virus-infected ones for all the tested cultivars (Fig. [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0001) b, d, f and h). Among the cultivars tested, irrespective of the virus status, Ejumula was the most severely affected, followed by Dimbuka and least in Kabode and NASPOT 1. For cultivar NASPOT 1 and Dimbuka, disease severity was high at 3 months after which, there was decline in severity in plants singly infected by SPFMV or SPCSV in both locations.\n\n[![Details are in the caption following the image](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f8d41ea3-d4d1-4e09-b7a8-743083da81a7/jph12451-fig-0001-m.png)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5372f614-55e9-4656-817e-db25efbc1106/jph12451-fig-0001-m.jpg)\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n[Open in figure viewer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#) [PowerPoint](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadFigures?id=jph12451-fig-0001&partId=&doi=10.1111%2Fjph.12451)\n\nDisease severity curve showing response of sweetpotato cultivars to virus infection in two agro-ecologies.

The remaining eight viruses were negative in all the samples tested. SPCSV followed by SPFMV was more prevalent at MUARIK while in NaSARRI, the incidences of both viruses were low. At NaSARRI, most of the cultivars showed reversion from SPFMV infection, initially infected plants mostly testing negative by ELISA and graft inoculation to _I. setosa_ at the end of the trial (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0001 \"Link to table\")). The reversion from SPFMV was also evident at MUARIK where some of the cultivars initially infected with SPFMV did not develop SPVD symptoms when infected with SPCSV under natural conditions. Instead, symptoms of SPCSV alone were expressed, and plants tested negative by ELISA for SPFMV and positive for SPCSV (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0001 \"Link to table\")).\n\n| Cultivar | Virus Status | Number of plant samples | Positive samples at MUARIK (%) | Positive samples at NaSARRI (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SPFMV | SPCSV | SPVD | SPFMV | SPCSV | SPVD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NASPOT 1 | Healthy control | 30 | 46.7 | 93.3 | 46.7 | 0.0 | 20.0 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0001_42 \"Link to note\") | 30 | 33.3 | 60.0 | 23.3 | 20.0 | 6.6 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0002_43 \"Link to note\") | 15 | 60.0 | 80.0 | 33.3 | 0.0 | 26.7 | 0.0 |\n| Dimbuka | Healthy control | 30 | 13.3 | 93.3 | 13.3 | 0.0 | 3.3 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0001_44 \"Link to note\") | 30 | 20.0 | 40.0 | 20.0 | 26.7 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0002_45 \"Link to note\") | 15 | 66.7 | 86.7 | 33.3 | 6.0 | 6.7 | 0.0 |\n| Ejumula | Healthy control | 30 | 86.7 | 100.0 | 86.7 | 0.0 | 13.3 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0001_46 \"Link to note\") | 30 | 100.0 | 80.0 | 80.0 | 53.3 | 20.0 | 6.7 |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0002_47 \"Link to note\") | 15 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 13.3 | 26.7 | 3.3 |\n| Kabode | Healthy control | 30 | 13.3 | 100.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 16.7 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0001_48 \"Link to note\") | 30 | 26.7 | 86.7 | 26.7 | 6.0 | 10.0 | 0.0 |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0002_49 \"Link to note\") | 15 | 26.7 | 100.0 | 26.7 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Beauregard | Healthy control | 15 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0001_50 \"Link to note\") | 15 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 |\n\n- _a_\nSPFMV-infected cutting obtained from screenhouse and grown in the field for the first time.\n\n- _b_\nSPFMV-infected cuttings obtained from 1st trial and grown in the field for the 2nd time.

Higher absorbance values were observed in plants with mixed infections than those with single infection in both locations and in all the cultivars tested (Fig. [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0003)). Also plants singly infected by SPCSV accumulated more viral antigen and never showed recovery as most of them tested positive unlike those plants infected by SPFMV alone in which most of them tested negative. The results also showed high spread of SPCSV within the fields as most of the samples from healthy control and those previously infected by SPFMV tested positive for SPCSV. The spread was greater at MUARIK than NaSARRI with samples from MUARIK having high absorbance values except in the case of SPVD (Fig. [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0003)).\n\n[![Details are in the caption following the image](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c988f08a-fab8-47b5-a820-a52c86477904/jph12451-fig-0003-m.png)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9bb92f9f-96ad-4ee1-82b1-5a91861ad697/jph12451-fig-0003-m.jpg)\n\n**Figure 3**\n\n[Open in figure viewer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#) [PowerPoint](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadFigures?id=jph12451-fig-0003&partId=&doi=10.1111%2Fjph.12451)\n\n_Absorbance values from detection of SPFMV antigens by DAS-ELISA and SPCSV antigen by TAS ELISA in leaves of four sweetpotato cultivars 5 months after planting in two agro-ecologies. (a) Absorbance value for samples from MUARIK and (b) absorbance value for samples from NaSARRI. All samples were tested for the two viruses. Each data point corresponds to the A_ _405_ _values from 30 different plant samples per cultivar in two experiments. Bars represent standard error of means_.\n\n### Effect of SPFMV on the yield of sweetpotato cultivars in two agro-ecologies\n\nThe yield and number of storage roots produced by sweetpotato varied depending on the cultivars, virus status, season of growth and location. Between locations, more yield and higher storage root number were observed in MUARIK than NaSARRI. Because of high variation observed between location and seasons, each yield data set for each season and location was analysed individually and the results presented as below.\n\nFor the 1st field trial at MUARIK, there was no significant yield difference between SPFMV-infected plants and healthy control plants of all the cultivars tested except Dimbuka. However, cvs, Kabode and NASPOT 1 infected with SPFMV had slightly more yield than the healthy control, while the healthy controls of Ejumula and Beauregard had slightly better yields than those of SPFMV-infected plants (Table [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0002 \"Link to table\")). The total and marketable number of storage root for healthy and SPFMV-infected plants within each cultivar was not different. Among the cultivars tested, Dimbuka had the greatest number of storage roots, followed by Ejumula, NASPOT 1, Kabode and least in Beauregard. For NaSARRI trial, significantly higher total and marketable yield effect was observed between healthy control plants and SPFMV-infected plants of cultivars NASPOT 1, Dimbuka and Beauregard. For cultivar Kabode and Ejumula, there was no difference on the yield between healthy control and SPFMV-infected plants (Table [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0002 \"Link to table\")). The yield loss due to SPFMV in this location ranged from 14% to 67% depending on the cultivar. The number of storage roots was greatest in Dimbuka followed by NASPOT 1, then Kabode, Ejumula and least in Beauregard. The storage root numbers within cultivar were not different (Table [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0002 \"Link to table\")).\n\n| Cultivar | Virus status | MUARIK | NaSARRI |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yield (Kg/m2) | Root numbers (per mounds) | Yield (Kg/m2) | Root numbers (per mounds) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kabode | Healthy | 2.0a | 1.8a | 6.4a | 5.2a | 1.1a | 0.8a | 3.7a | 2.2a |\n| SPFMV | 2.6a | 2.3a | 7.5a | 5.7a | 1.3a | 1.0a | 4.3a | 3.1a |\n| NASPOT 1 | Healthy | 3.0a | 2.6b | 9.9a | 6.1a | 2.3a | 2.1a | 5.3a | 4.9a |\n| SPFMV | 3.8a | 3.7a | 8.6a | 6.5a | 1.4b | 1.1b | 3.7a | 2.8b |\n| Ejumula | Healthy | 2.1a | 1.4a | 12.4a | 4.9a | 0.7a | 0.2a | 3.1a | 0.4a |\n| SPFMV | 1.9a | 1.3a | 13.3a | 4.4a | 0.6a | 0.1a | 2.8a | 0.5a |\n| Dimbuka | Healthy | 2.7b | 2.1b | 15.1a | 6.0b | 1.4a | 1.1a | 7.9a | 4.0a |\n| SPFV | 4.4a | 4.0a | 15.5a | 10.2a | 0.9a | 0.6b | 3.3b | 1.7b |\n| Beauregard | Healthy | 1.2a | 0.7a | 12.3a | 3.1a | 0.6a | 0.0a | 5.3a | 0.0a |\n| SPFV | 0.7a | 0.2a | 5.8b | 1.1a | 0.2b | 0.0a | 1.5b | 0.0a |\n| SE |  | 0.36 | 0.37 | 1.42 | 0.86 | 0.15 | 0.16 | 0.71 | 0.495 |\n| LSD (5%) |  | 1.00 | 1.03 | 3.98 | 2.40 | 0.422 | 0.46 | 1.98 | 1.385 |\n\n- SE, standard errors of means; LSD, least significant difference at 5%.\n\n- Columns with the same superscript letters for individual cultivar is not significantly different.\n\n\n### Cumulative effects of SPFMV on the yield of sweetpotato in two agro-ecologies\n\nThe cumulative effect of SPFMV was conducted by planting a 2nd field trial using SPFMV-infected cuttings from the first field trial along with the newly infected SPFMV materials obtained from a screenhouse and virus-indexed material as healthy control at MUARIK and NaSARRI, respectively. Significant differences were detected among cultivars, vine source and interaction between cultivars and vine source in both locations for total yield, marketable yield, total number of storage root and marketable number of storage roots (Table [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0003 \"Link to table\")). In both locations, the yield of healthy control was greater than the SPFMV-infected ones (Table [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0003 \"Link to table\")). For the MUARIK trial, the newly SPFMV-infected materials from the screenhouse had more total and marketable yield and storage root number than the SPFMV-infected materials obtained from 1st field trial. The total yield loss due to SPFMV-infected material from screenhouse ranged between 0% and 23.8% while the total yield loss due to SPFMV-infected materials obtained from the 1st field trial ranged between 14% and 26.1% (Table [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0003 \"Link to table\")). The exception was in cv, Kabode, in which the field exposed material had slightly more yield than screenhouse-infected materials although statistically not different from the healthy control. For the NaSARRI trial, SPFMV-infected materials from the 1st field trial yielded more than the screenhouse-infected materials planted in the field for the first time in all the cultivars except Dimbuka. The total yield loss of screenhouse-infected materials ranged between 33% and 42% while that of field exposed material ranged between 26% and 48% (Table [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0003 \"Link to table\")). The total root numbers within cultivars were not different, but the marketable root numbers were different for the NaSARRI trial. Dimbuka had more storage roots, followed by NASPOT 1, Ejumula and least in Kabode (Table [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0003 \"Link to table\")).\n\n| Cultivar | Virus status | MUARIK | NaSARRI |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yield (Kg/m2) | Root number (per mound) | Yield (Kg/m2) | Root numbers (per mound) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kabode | Healthy | 2.1ab | 1.6a | 6.7ab | 3.6a | 1.5a | 1.5a | 5.6a | 4.7a |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0005_62 \"Link to note\") | 1.6b | 1.2a | 5.0b | 2.7a | 1.0b | 0.9b | 6.7a | 4.2a |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0006_63 \"Link to note\") | 2.7a | 2.1a | 8.1a | 4.5a | 1.1ab | 1.0b | 5.9a | 4.3a |\n| NASPOT 1 | Healthy | 2.8a | 1.7a | 4.9a | 3.3a | 2.4a | 2.3a | 9.7a | 7.9a |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0005_64 \"Link to note\") | 2.5a | 1.8a | 7.7a | 3.2a | 1.4b | 1.2b | 8.4b | 5.8b |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0006_65 \"Link to note\") | 2.4a | 2.1a | 6.1a | 4.1a | 1.7b | 1.5b | 8.1b | 5.7b |\n| Ejumula | Healthy | 2.3a | 1.5a | 7.5a | 4.2a | 2.1a | 2.1a | 8.9a | 7.3a |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0005_66 \"Link to note\") | 1.8ab | 1.4a | 9.7a | 3.2a | 1.3b | 1.1b | 7.7a | 4.5b |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0006_67 \"Link to note\") | 1.5b | 0.8b | 7.5a | 2.4a | 1.5b | 1.3b | 8.1a | 5.7ab |\n| Dimbuka | Healthy | 2.3a | 1.6a | 10.9a | 4.2a | 1.9a | 1.7a | 12.3a | 8.7a |\n| SPFMV [a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0005_68 \"Link to note\") | 2.3a | 1.3ab | 11.5a | 3.3ab | 1.1b | 0.8b | 10.9a | 5.2b |\n| SPFMV [b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-note-0006_69 \"Link to note\") | 1.7a | 0.6b | 8.7a | 1.5b | 1.0b | 0.8b | 10.1a | 4.3b |\n| LSD (5%) |  | 0.75 | 0.86 | 2.87 | 1.88 | 0.3594 | 0.3509 | 2.469 | 1.674 |\n\n- _a_\nSPFMV-infected cutting obtained from screenhouse and grown in the field for the first time.\n\n- _b_\nSPFMV-infected cuttings obtained from 1st trial and grown in the field for the 2nd time.\n\n- Columns with the same superscript letter for individual cultivar is not significantly different.\n\n\n### Effects of single or mixed infection by SPFMV and SPCSV under field conditions\n\nIn general, the total yield, marketable yield, total storage root number and marketable root number were significantly influenced by seasons within location, cultivars tested, the viruses used and their interactions. Storage root yield was greater in field trial 4 than in field trial 3 in both locations. Combination of SPFMV and SPCSV severely reduced the yield, followed by the single infection of SPCSV and least in single infection by SPFMV and healthy controls.\n\nThe total and marketable yields of sweetpotato cultivars singly infected by SPFMV were less than the healthy controls in field trial 3 and 4 in both locations except for NASPOT 1 and Ejumula in trial 4 at MUARIK although these differences were not statistically significant. The total yield loss due to SPFMV ranged between 7% and 38% for all the cultivars in both locations except for NASPOT 1 and Ejumula during the 4th field trial at MUARIK where there was a yield gain of 111 and 114%, respectively. SPFMV alone did not affect the total number of storage root but reduced the marketable root number in all the cultivars in both seasons and locations except for cultivars NASPOT 1 and Ejumula in the 4th field trial where the total number of storage roots was less than the healthy control (Table [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0004 \"Link to table\")).\n\n| Cultivars | Virus status | MUARIK | NaSARRI |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yield (Kg/m2) | Root numbers (per mound) | Storage root Length/diameter ratio | Yield (kg/m2) | Root number (per mound) | Storage root Length/diameter ratio |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable | Total | Marketable |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3rd Field trial |\n| Kabode | Healthy | 1.4a | 1.2a | 6.5a | 4.1a | 1.1b | 1.5a | 1.4a | 4.7a | 4.5a | 0.9b |\n| SPFMV | 1.3a | 1.0ab | 5.0ab | 2.4b | 1.1b | 1.3ab | 1.3ab | 4.1ab | 3.9ab | 0.9b |\n| SPCSV | 0.9b | 0.8b | 4.2bc | 2.6b | 1.3ab | 1.1b | 1.1b | 3.5b | 3.0bc | 0.8b |\n| SPVD | 0.4c | 0.4c | 2.3c | 1.5b | 1.5a | 0.6c | 0.5c | 3.1b | 2.1c | 1.3a |\n| NASPOT 1 | Healthy | 1.6a | 1.3a | 6.1a | 3.9a | 0.8b | 1.9a | 1.9a | 6.2a | 6.1a | 0.8b |\n| SPFMV | 1.0b | 0.6b | 5.6ab | 2.3b | 0.9ab | 1.3b | 1.3b | 4.9a | 4.1b | 0.8b |\n| SPCSV | 1.1b | 0.8b | 5.7ab | 2.7b | 0.9ab | 1.4b | 1.3b | 5.1a | 4.3b | 0.9ab |\n| SPVD | 0.5c | 0.5b | 4.0c | 1.6b | 1.1a | 0.1c | 0.1c | 0.8b | 0.3c | 1.1a |\n| Ejumula | Healthy | 1.6a | 1.2a | 7.5a | 3.9a | 1.2a | 1.5a | 1.4a | 5.7a | 4.8a | 0.9b |\n| SPFMV | 1.1b | 0.7b | 6.4a | 2.1b | 1.2a | 1.3ab | 1.3a | 5.1a | 4.4ab | 1.0b |\n| SPCSV | 0.8b | 0.4b | 6.3a | 2.0bc | 1.1a | 1.1b | 1.0b | 4.9a | 3.3b | 0.8b |\n| SPVD | 0.2c | 0.2c | 2.6b | 0.9c | 1.3a | 0.3c | 0.2c | 1.6b | 1.3c | 1.3a |\n| Dimbuka | Healthy | 2.1a | 1.3a | 12.6a | 4.1a | 0.8b | 2.1a | 2.1a | 7.7a | 6.4a | 0.7b |\n| SPFMV | 1.3b | 0.9b | 6.5b | 2.8b | 0.9b | 1.9a | 1.8b | 7.0a | 6.1a | 0.7b |\n| SPCSV | 1.0b | 0.7b | 7.8b | 2.9b | 1.0ab | 1.5b | 1.5c | 6.5a | 4.7b | 0.7b |\n| SPVD | 0.1c | 0.0c | 2.1c | 0.5c | 1.2a | 0.1c | 0.0d | 1.2b | 0.1c | 1.4a |\n| SE |  | 0.123 | 0.134 | 0.711 | 0.431 | 0.0763 | 0.098 | 0.1032 | 0.496 | 0.421 | 0.0763 |\n| LSD (5%) |  | 0.342 | 0.374 | 1.981 | 1.202 | 0.2203 | 0.274 | 0.2877 | 1.381 | 1.172 | 0.2205 |\n| Field trial4 |\n| Kabode | Healthy | 3.1a | 3.1a | 6.4a | 6.3a | 1.0b | 1.6a | 1.5a | 6.0a | 5.3a | 1.3a |\n| SPFMV | 2.4b | 2.4b | 5.8a | 5.1ab | 1.1ab | 1.3a | 1.2a | 6.7a | 5.0a | 1.3a |\n| SPCSV | 1.9b | 1.8c | 5.3a | 3.7b | 1.1ab | 1.3a | 1.2a | 5.2ab | 4.1a | 1.3a |\n| SPVD | 0.7c | 0.6d | 3.7b | 1.9c | 1.2a | 0.7b | 0.6b | 4.5b | 2.5b | 1.4a |\n| NASPOT 1 | Healthy | 2.7a | 2.6a | 7.9a | 6.9a | 0.8c | 2.2a | 2.0a | 10.5a | 8.2a | 1.1c |\n| SPFMV | 3.0a | 2.9a | 7.3a | 6.5a | 0.9ab | 1.8b | 1.6b | 8.0c | 5.4b | 1.2b |\n| SPCSV | 2.0b | 1.9b | 7.1a | 5.7a | 1.0a | 1.1c | 1.0c | 5.7c | 4.7b | 1.2b |\n| SPVD | 0.4c | 0.3c | 3.0b | 1.5b | 1.0a | 0.1d | 0.0d | 1.3d | 0.0c | 1.4a |\n| Ejumula | Healthy | 2.1ab | 2.1ab | 7.9a | 7.1a | 1.1a | 2.1a | 1.9a | 10.9a | 8.7a | 1.2a |\n| SPFMV | 2.4a | 2.3a | 9.5a | 8.7a | 1.2a | 1.4b | 1.1b | 8.0b | 4.9b | 1.2a |\n| SPCSV | 1.8b | 1.6b | 7.9a | 5.1b | 1.2a | 1.0c | 0.8b | 6.3b | 4.0b | 1.2a |\n| SPVD | 0.4c | 0.2c | 3.7b | 1.0c | 1.2a | 0.3d | 0.2c | 2.8c | 1.2c | 1.3a |\n| Dimbuka | Healthy | 3.1a | 3.0a | 13.4a | 10.3a | 0.8b | 2.3a | 2.0a | 13.0a | 9.8a | 1.0a |\n| SPFMV | 2.5b | 2.3b | 11.5a | 8.3b | 0.9b | 1.4b | 1.2b | 11.6a | 7.7b | 1.1a |\n| SPCSV | 1.7c | 1.5c | 9.1b | 5.7c | 0.9b | 1.6b | 1.3b | 11.5a | 7.5b | 1.1a |\n| SPVD | 0.8d | 0.6d | 8.8b | 3.1d | 1.1a | 0.1c | 0.0c | 1.7b | 0.0c | 1.1a |\n| SE |  | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.79 | 0.58 | 0.0763 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.67 | 0.47 | 0.0742 |\n| LSD (5%) |  | 0.580 | 0.584 | 2.220 | 1.623 | 0.2203 | 0.310 | 0.3168 | 1.872 | 1.323 | 0.2144 |\n\n- Columns with the same superscript letters for each cultivar are not significantly different, SPVD = plants co-infected by SPFMV and SPCSV.\n\n\nSingle infection by SPCSV significantly reduced the total and marketable yield and total and marketable storage number of roots as compared to healthy plant in both locations and in all the field trials (Table [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0004 \"Link to table\")). The yield loss due to SPCSV ranged between 14% and 52% for all the cultivars tested in both locations for 3rd and 4th field trial (Table [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0004 \"Link to table\")). The marketable yield, total storage root number and marketable storage root number were less in SPCSV-infected plants compared to the healthy control. Cultivars Ejumula and Dimbuka had the greatest total yield loss due to SPCSV during 3rd field trials in both locations, while in 4th field trial only Dimbuka had greatest yield loss at MUARIK and Ejumula at NaSARRI. Co-infection of SPFMV and SPCSV had an even larger effect on total yield, marketable yield and total and marketable storage root number. The yield loss ranged between 60% and 95% with Ejumula and Dimbuka having the greatest total yield loss in both locations in all seasons.\n\n### Effects of SPFMV and SPCSV on sweetpotato root length and diameter\n\nDifferences were detected (P ≤ 0.05) on the length and diameter of storage roots due to cultivar and virus effect and their interaction. Both single infection and co-infection of SPFMV and SPCSV reduced the diameter of storage roots. Storage roots of plants infected by both SPFMV and SPCSV had the smallest diameter followed by that infected by SPCSV alone and then SPFMV. Healthy plants overall had storage roots with the greatest diameter and therefore less length diameter ratio (Table [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0004 \"Link to table\")).\n\n## Discussion\n\nSymptom expression differed with the infecting viruses and cultivars. SPFMV-infected plants produced mild symptoms in all the cultivars which later disappeared under field conditions. This suggests that these cultivars are resistant or tolerant to SPFMV infection. Such apparent tolerance may have been developed through unintentional selection by farmers (for land races) or breeders growing crops under strong disease pressure and high vector population. This finding supports reports that most Ugandan cultivars are resistant to SPFMV and when infected can revert to healthy status (Gibson et al. [1997](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0011); Mukasa et al. [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0025); Wasswa [2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0032); Gibson and Kreuze [2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0010)). This reversion was further confirmed when some of the previously infected plants from the field at NaSARRI tested negative for SPFMV using NCM ELISA and when grafted on _I. setosa_. Also reversion from SPFMV was evident at MUARIK where initially SPFMV-infected plants did not develop SPVD when infected naturally with SPCSV, instead they tested negative for SPFMV at the end of the trial. Beauregard which is a cultivar from America was very susceptible to SPFMV and SPCSV (Bryan et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0004); Clark and Hoy [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0005)), it was discarded for later trials and cannot be used by farmers in Uganda because it cannot be maintained, reaching 100% infection by both viruses within one season (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-tbl-0001 \"Link to table\")).\n\nInfection by SPCSV alone induced clear symptoms under field condition in all the cultivars. Typical symptoms of SPCSV observed were chlorotic spots, purpling and yellowing of middle and mature leaves similar to symptoms reported by Gibson et al. ([1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012)). Co-infection of SPFMV+SPCSV resulted in severe disease symptoms due to a synergistic interaction between them (Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012); Untiveros et al. [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0030)).\n\nThe titre of both SPFMV and SPCSV was high in co-infected plants as compared to single-infected plants for all cultivars evaluated, suggesting that the symptoms observed were the result of higher accumulation of both viruses in infected plants. This is contradicting the previous finding that the titre of SPCSV in co-infected plants either declines or remains constant (Karyeija et al. [2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0018); Kokkinos and Clark [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0019)). However, their finding was based on experiments under screenhouse conditions. In this experiment, field conditions might have influenced virus replication and also other viruses such as begomoviruses which were not evaluated in this study and are known to be common in some cultivars in Uganda (Wasswa et al. [2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0033)) could have infected the plants leading to synergistic interaction among them hence higher titre (Cuellar et al. [2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0008)), but this requires further investigation. Also SPCSV seems to be the major virus in symptom development as most of the plants infected by SPCSV alone displayed very clear symptoms and produced high titre value indicating their accumulation in plants. On the other hand, SPFMV when infecting alone does not easily accumulate in the plant, and therefore, little or no symptoms were produced.\n\nEffect of single infection of SPFMV on yield of sweetpotato was variable ranging from better apparent yield performance to yield loss as high as 40% depending on the agro-ecologies, seasons and cultivar tested. Yields of cultivars, NASPOT 1, Dimbuka and Kabode infected with SPFMV were greater or did not differ from controls at MUARIK trial, but in these, the healthy control became largely infected by SPFMV but also SPCSV whilst some of the infected plants reverted to healthy so infected plants may have had a lower level of virus infection than the control plants (Fig [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0002) a). It could also be that prior infection with SPFMV conferred a specific protection against itself thus limiting its multiplication and accumulation in the infected plants. Alternatively, it could have conferred nonspecific protection against other viruses probably due to more activated RNA silencing pathway (Kreuze et al. [2005](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0020)). Similar results have also been reported in Peru (Gutierrez et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0013)) and Israel (Milgram et al. [1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0022)). This finding justifies why these varieties are widely grown by farmers in central region with high virus disease pressure and therefore supports the use of field derived planting material of resistant or tolerant varieties to reduce the impact of the virus. However, previously field exposed material when reused in the subsequent season produced smaller yields than freshly SPFMV-infected material from the screenhouse especially in the susceptible cultivar, Ejumula. When tested using ELISA, most of the sweetpotato plants were positive for SPCSV and accumulation of this virus may have resulted in the smaller yields. This therefore discourages farmers from obtaining cuttings from their field for such a susceptible variety in areas with high virus incidence like MUARIK.\n\nAt NaSARRI, however, SPFMV negatively impacted on the yield of all cultivars tested despite less visible virus symptoms and the initially healthy control largely remain healthy in contrast to what was observed at MUARIK (Fig. [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-fig-0002)). The lower infection rate in the healthy control may be because of few aphid vectors of SPFMV or few whitefly vectors of SPCSV so that there were few SPVD-affected plants to act as excellent sources of SPFMV.\n\nSingle infection of SPCSV significantly reduced the yield of all sweetpotato cultivars in both locations and proved clearly to be the most economically important virus in the central region of Uganda. The yield loss ranged from 14% to 52% in all the cultivars tested in the two locations. In other studies, yield losses of between 15% and 88% have been reported (Milgram et al. [1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0022); Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012); Gutierrez et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0013); Njeru et al. [2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0027); Untiveros et al. [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0030)). However, the situation was worsened when SPCSV co-infected with SPFMV resulted in yield losses ranging from 60% to 95% similar to that reported earlier (Sheffield [1957](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0029); Schaefers and Terry [1976](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0028); Milgram et al. [1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0022); Gibson et al. [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0012); Gutierrez et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0013)). The reduced root yield in sweetpotato has been attributed to decrease in size of photosynthetic organs resulting from severe stunting and other symptoms of SPVD due to synergistic interaction (Hahn et al. [1981](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0014); Njeru et al. [2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0027)).\n\nIn addition to yield loss, planting virus-infected cuttings also reduced the root quality in terms of the size and number of roots produced. Virus-infected plants produced roots with small diameter and therefore giving higher ratios of length/diameter as compared to the control plants. The length/diameter ratio was greatest in co-infection followed by SPCSV infection and SPFMV infection. This result is consistent with other studies, for example, Kano and Nagata ([1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0015)) found that SPFMV-infected plants produce roots with a smaller diameter than storage roots produced from healthy plants. Similarly, Bryan et al. ([2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0004)) reported that SPFMV-infected plants produce roots with greater length diameter ratio compared to healthy control. In terms of number of storage roots produced, SPFMV-infected plants had similar number of total roots per mound with the healthy control plants. On the other hand, the total number of storage roots was significantly less in SPCSV-infected plants and plants infected by a combination of SPFMV and SPCSV compared to healthy controls.\n\nThe variation in yield and number of storage roots of the same cultivar in different locations or seasons could be due to differences in environmental factors. Sweetpotato yield is greatly influenced by the environment (Collins et al. [1987](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0007); Kanua and Floyd [1988](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0016); Bryan et al. [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jph.12451#jph12451-bib-0004)), and the widely differing environmental conditions between MUARIK and NaSARRI undoubtedly impacted the yield of controls and virus-infected plants. At MUARIK, the rainfall pattern is uniformly distributed throughout the year which favours production of sweetpotato, and thus, better yield as compared to NaSARRI in which most parts of the year remains hot and dry thus reducing the yield of sweetpotatoes. The continuous production of sweetpotato at MUARIK allows survival of pathogens and their vectors; thus, continuous disease spread leading to virus accumulation in the plant as was evidenced by the high disease severity. This was further supported by the fact that healthy controls became infected and some of the SPFMV-infected plants developed SPVD symptoms by the end of the growing season despite the use of a pesticide to control whiteflies in 3rd and 4th trial at MUARIK. This implies that pesticides may not be of use in managing virus vectors, instead more emphasis should be put in breeding and growing resistant cultivars for such areas with high vector and disease pressure. In NaSARRI, however, the hot dry spell in some months discourages sweetpotato production and this breaks the pathogen and pest cycle and may be the cause of reduced virus spread. This was further supported by the fact that no pesticides were applied, but most of the healthy controls did not develop virus symptoms and tested negative using ELISA and _I. setosa_. This therefore implies that both susceptible and resistant varieties can be grown in this area and also field multiplication of virus-indexed sweetpotato materials can be carried out in this agro-ecology provided the issue of drought is addressed.\n\nThis study has demonstrated that single infection with SPCSV and its co-infection with SPFMV are serious threats to sweetpotato production in the central region and other regions where the whitefly population is high. Here, there is a need to focus on resistant varieties and farmer selection of symptomless planting material, and virus cleaned material was, by itself, insufficient. Although SPFMV reduced yield, its effect alone was not very great as most of the Ugandan cultivars were resistant to it and could revert from single infection. Pesticide application proved not to be effective in controlling virus spread and therefore should not be used as this will increase the cost of production to little apparent benefit.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis study was funded by the International Potato Center (CIP) through the Sweetpotato Action for Security and Health in Africa (SASHA) project.

Hoveyda's father was a lapsed adherent of the [Baháʼí Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith \"Baháʼí Faith\") and Hoveyda himself was not religious.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-chehabi_188-3) He was the nephew of [Abdol Hossein Sardari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdol_Hossein_Sardari \"Abdol Hossein Sardari\"), also known as \" [Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler \"Oskar Schindler\") of Iran\". Because of the responsibilities borne by diplomats such as Ayn ol-Molk, the Hoveyda family was never fixed in one residence for any prolonged length of time. Studying in various countries gave Hoveyda a unique cosmopolitan flair that would remain his most enduring characteristic. During the family's stay in [Beirut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut \"Beirut\"), [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon \"Lebanon\"), Hoveyda attended [Lycée Français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Fran%C3%A7ais \"Lycée Français\"), an institution affiliated with the French government. His love for France and its culture were rooted in his tutelage at the lycée. French literary works by the likes of [André Gide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide \"André Gide\"), [André Malraux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Malraux \"André Malraux\"), [Molière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re \"Molière\"), and [Baudelaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudelaire \"Baudelaire\"), captivated the young Hoveyda and gave way for his intellectual growth. Some pundits suggest that it was Hoveyda's intellectual prowess which initially attracted him into the [Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Shah \"Mohammad Reza Shah\")'s folds.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-4)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Brussels_hoveyda_university_1941.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brussels_hoveyda_university_1941.jpg) Hoveyda in Brussels during the German occupation in 1941\n\nHoveyda's desire to attend a French university in 1938 made the young student jump the gun by entering the country of his dreams without completing specific high school prerequisites required for entry. Cited as being the main reason behind Hoveyda's organizational miscalculation was the possibility of military action by an ostensibly belligerent [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\"). Any future occupation of the country would have hindered his chances of attending a French university. Stranded in France, Hoveyda decided to complete the required high school credits in London, England, a city that would come to depress the young man. Aside from completing his educational requisites, Hoveyda was able to sharpen his command of the English language. His ability to communicate in several languages, including Persian, French, English, Italian, German, and Arabic, helped him climb the political ladder later on in life. Hoveyda's return to France in 1939 would be short lived, nevertheless, due to a brewing diplomatic scuffle between the French government and [Reza Shah Pahlavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Shah_Pahlavi \"Reza Shah Pahlavi\"). Having no choice but to leave France again, Hoveyda enrolled at the [Free University of Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_of_Brussels_(1834%E2%80%931969) \"Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)\") in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels \"Brussels\"), Belgium, during the same year. His stay at the university would be markedly ephemeral because of the effects of the [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\") [Blitzkrieg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg \"Blitzkrieg\") which used Belgian territory as an entry route into France. After being displaced for a short time, Hoveyda was able to return to the Belgian university, obtaining a bachelor's degree in [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science \"Political science\") in 1941, under the ever-watchful eye of the occupying [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\") administration.\n\n## Military and public service\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Military and public service\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Shah_hoveyda_1943.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shah_hoveyda_1943.jpg) Hoveyda (right) as an officer, meeting with [Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Shah_Pahlavi \"Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi\") for the first time in 1943\n\nUpon his return to Iran in 1942, Hoveyda rested for a few months before enlisting as a soldier in Iran's national army. His plan at the time was to use his experience as a conscript to supplement his seniority at the foreign ministry where he applied for employment prior to being drafted. Because of his higher education, Hoveyda was able to bypass boot camp and directly enter the Officer's Academy. Iran's modern [Prime Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers \"Prime Ministers\"), until that point, were able to avoid military service, but Hoveida voluntarily chose to enlist. Although rooted in aristocracy himself, Hoveyda's decision is portentous in the sense that resources that were readily available for his predecessors were often scarce for the young government official.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry dispatched a message eight months later confirming Hoveyda's appointment. To some, the quick application process is evidence enough to suggest that there were influential forces that helped expedite Hoveyda's subsequent employment. These claims, however, are often based on hearsay rather than substantiated facts. During his time in the Ministry, Hoveyda befriended many elements of Iranian high society, including the likes of [Sadeq Hedayat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeq_Hedayat \"Sadeq Hedayat\") and [Sadeq Chubak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeq_Chubak \"Sadeq Chubak\"). His affinity for the country's intelligentsia is clearly observed in his earlier strategy as [PM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister \"Prime minister\"). By trying to consolidate the partnership between the monarchial regime and the intellectual opposition, Hoveyda believed that the incremental reforms he desired would bear fruit. Others like [Jalal al-e Ahmad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalal_Al-e-Ahmad \"Jalal Al-e-Ahmad\"), writer and social and political critic, saw Hoveyda's 'infiltration' of Iran's intellectual ranks as a form of sycophancy. On the other hand, [Hedayat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadegh_Hedayat \"Sadegh Hedayat\") and other eccentric characters were quick to identify and repel opportunists who were attempting to leech off their social status. Hedayat and others never distanced themselves from Hoveyda, symbolizing the latter's authenticity.\n\nAs Hoveyda garnered more experience, opportunities within Iran's governmental apparatus were becoming available to him. In August 1944, for instance, he accepted a position to accompany [Zein ol-Abedin Rahnema](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zein_ol-Abedin_Rahnema&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Zein ol-Abedin Rahnema (page does not exist)\"), Iran's minister [plenipotentiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenipotentiary \"Plenipotentiary\"), to France. Being an avid [Francophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francophile \"Francophile\"), Hoveyda would enjoy his time as an embassy official, but he would soon be entangled in an international scandal that would taint him for the rest of his life. The \" [Paris Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paris_Story&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Paris Story (page does not exist)\")\" recounts the illegal importation of financial assets, stored in [Swiss banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_banks \"Swiss banks\") during the war for security purposes, from Switzerland into the coffers of wealthy [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people \"French people\") businessmen in 1945. To avoid border taxes, diplomatic personnel were persuaded to act as the intermediary, simply because embassy vehicles were, by law, unable to be searched. Although Hoveida never had anything to do with the illegal transfers, his mere association with some of those indicted was enough for him to be used as a [scapegoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat \"Scapegoat\") in the affair.\n\nAside from experience, [patronage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage \"Patronage\") from the likes of [Abdullah Entezam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Entezam \"Abdullah Entezam\"), an independent minded diplomat of \"sterling reputation\", served to aid Hoveida's ascendance to the upper echelons of public office. With the government of [Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Shah_Pahlavi \"Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi\"), the [Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah \"Shah\") (king) of Iran, the only way to obtain high ranking positions in any societal position was through crucial internal patronage, reinforcement Hoveyda sufficiently lacked prior to working with [Entezam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entezam \"Entezam\"). The two first got to work together when Hoveyda was stationed in [Stuttgart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart \"Stuttgart\"), [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany \"West Germany\"). While there in 1947, Hoveyda was assigned with the task of negotiating over deals made between Iran and Germany. The most notable case involved Iran's purchase of factory equipment required for the construction of a steel mill, in which the transaction of the material components were never successfully completed.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/NIOC_Board_Members.jpg/440px-NIOC_Board_Members.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NIOC_Board_Members.jpg) Hoveyda as National Iranian Oil Company Board member, 4th from the right\n\nIn 1950, Hoveyda returned to an ever-changing Iran once again. This time, he would be caught in one of the most tumultuous periods of Iran's modern period. As Hoveyda toiled away at a notably boring job as assistant director of the public relations office at the Foreign Ministry, [Mohammad Mossadegh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mossadegh \"Mohammad Mossadegh\") was mobilizing nationalist sentiment as he rose to power. During this period, Entezam was appointed as minister of foreign affairs, allowing Hoveyda to assume a more intellectually stimulating role as Entezam's executive secretary. His tenure did not last long before [Mossadegh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossadegh \"Mossadegh\") was appointed [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister \"Prime Minister\"), dissolving the former cabinet along with Hoveyda's job.\n\nLeaving Iran once again in 1952, Hoveyda was able to secure a position with the [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees \"United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\") through the help of his European contacts. As a liaison officer, he was given the task of visiting various continents, including Asia, Africa, and the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas \"Americas\"), promulgating the plight of refugees and in effect receiving several commendations from high ranking [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN \"UN\") officials.\n\nThe Iranian embassy in [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey \"Turkey\") would serve to be Hoveyda's final official position outside Iran's frontiers. Assistant to the ambassador, who so happened to be the father of his good friend, [Hassan-Ali Mansour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Ali_Mansur \"Hassan Ali Mansur\"), Hoveyda would make a quick exit after Mansour's father was replaced by an authoritarian army general in 1957.\n\n## Rise to power\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Rise to power\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_in_palace.jpg/440px-Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_in_palace.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_in_palace.jpg) Hoveyda after a cabinet meeting, January 1965\n\nHoveyda's rise to power involved many years of service within the ministry of foreign affairs, but this path took on a whole new approach once he joined the board of directors of the [National Iranian Oil Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Iranian_Oil_Company \"National Iranian Oil Company\") (NIOC) in 1958 at the behest of his patron [Abdullah Entezam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Entezam \"Abdullah Entezam\"), who had by then assumed a high ranking position at the company. As managing director and special assistant to Entezam, Hoveyda used his experiences in the West to transform management-worker relations. As an example, he introduced innovative methods by which workers filed grievances in regard to any aspect of the working environment they deemed unsatisfactory, and helped to figuratively enmesh the roles of management and the labourers into a collective entity. One way he went about doing this was by eating many of his meals alongside wage labourers in the cafeteria. Although he advocated the emulation of Western models to improve overall productivity and worker relations, Hoveyda was very outspoken in favour of expelling foreign technicians and attracting indigenous sources of labour. It was during his tenure in which the NIOC's periodical, _[Kavosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kavosh&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kavosh (page does not exist)\")_ (Persian: _Exploration_), was first published. What is unique about this magazine is that it was, initially, virtually void of any semblance of the growing cult of personality which surrounded the Shah.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-5)\n\nContinuing his duties as managing director at the NIOC, Hoveyda also helped [Hassan Ali Mansour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Ali_Mansour \"Hassan Ali Mansour\") in establishing a semi-independent group of highly trained, [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world \"Western world\") educated, and young [technocrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_(bureaucratic) \"Technocracy (bureaucratic)\"). The organization's main goal was to devise methods of rectifying the nation's ailing economy. Known as the [Progressive Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Circle \"Progressive Circle\"), this government sponsored dowreh (\"Persian for a gathering held at regular intervals\") was a deliberate attempt by the shah to thin out the older generation of politicians with a new 'progressive' crop. With its inception in 1959, the Circle acted in conjunction with a similar government commission called the [Plan Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plan_Organization&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Plan Organization (page does not exist)\"). Hoveyda would play a major leadership role in the Circle and would be the catalyst behind much of its recruitment efforts.\n\nBesides experience and patronage, [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry \"Freemasonry\") was seen by many politicians at the time as a supplemental credit towards obtaining high ranking government positions. It is no doubt that many members of the [Foroughi Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foroughi_Lodge&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Foroughi Lodge (page does not exist)\"), the chapter Hoveyda would eventually join, harboured and produced many influential politicians of Iran's modern era. Hoveyda became a freemason in 1960 believing that his mere association with the organization would help propel him into the national spotlight. Hoveida would succeed in this regard, but the attention he received was all but positive. Freemasonry in Iran has always been seen as an extension of British [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism \"Imperialism\"), and with rumours surrounding Hoveyda's religious persuasion, opportunities to attack Hoveyda's character were not taken for granted by his political adversaries during his years as head of [foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy \"Foreign policy\") and [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister \"Prime Minister\"). It is well documented that Court Minister [Asadollah Alam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asadollah_Alam \"Asadollah Alam\") and [General Nasiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematollah_Nassiri \"Nematollah Nassiri\") of SAVAK, Iran's domestic security and intelligence service, helped expedite the publication of key controversial books against Freemasonry, referencing Hoveyda in each piece. Rumours were also spread by his detractors that he was a [Baháʼí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith \"Baháʼí Faith\"), a [persecuted religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%ADs \"Persecution of Baháʼís\") in Iran, but both he and the Shah denied that he was a Baháʼí.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-7)[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-8)\n\n## Term as Prime Minister\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Term as Prime Minister\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Hoveyda_and_his_car.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoveyda_and_his_car.jpg) Hoveyda often chose to drive himself to work and around town in a [Paykan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paykan \"Paykan\"). His security detail often sat in the back seat. He is shown here with his Chief of Staff, Abdol Ali Ghaffari[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Hoveydacabinet1974.jpg/500px-Hoveydacabinet1974.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoveydacabinet1974.jpg) Hoveyda and his cabinet at the anniversary of the [White Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Revolution \"White Revolution\"), 1975\n\nWhen the Progressive Circle soon became a political entity in the form of the Iran Novin (New Iran) Party in 1963, Hoveyda would be thrust into the national scene. Flanking Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansour as his [Minister of Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Affairs_and_Finance_(Iran) \"Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (Iran)\") in 1964, the now well seasoned Hoveyda would make his mark by acting as the [cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hassan_Ali_Mansur \"Government of Hassan Ali Mansur\")'s intellectual centre. Many observers, both within and outside Iran, would take note of Hoveyda's prudent behaviour and shrewdness. To many, he embodied the archetypical statesman. Hoveyda's positive attributes would again be shrouded by scandal and gossip. During the early months of Mansour's premiership, the government was attacked for ratifying a bill which allowed foreigners [extraterritorial rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality \"Extraterritoriality\"). More specifically, those who benefited from the law were U.S. military personnel and their dependents. These \"capitulation rights\" would have a negative impact on the way government at the time was seen by the populace. Because the actions of the government were, by law, reflective of the sitting cabinet at the time, disregarding individual ministerial involvement, Hoveida was also blamed for the bill's implementation even though he was not directly involved in its drafting.\n\nAn attempt on Mansour's life on 21 January 1965, by a seventeen-year-old devotee of the [Fada'yan-e Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedayeen \"Fedayeen\"), and Mansour's death in hospital five days later, would completely alter Hoveyda's future. As he personally reported the news to an obviously distraught shah, he was ordered to formulate a cabinet. Hoveyda would replace the deceased Mansour as the longest running premier in Iran's modern history. The sense of autonomy seen among past prime ministers such as [Ali Amini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Amini \"Ali Amini\"), [Haj Ali Razmara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Ali_Razmara \"Haj Ali Razmara\"), and [Mohammad Mosaddegh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh \"Mohammad Mosaddegh\"), had been systematically marginalized by the autocratic Mohammad Reza Shah. In his rather successful campaign at consolidating power, the king maintained his international image as a constitutional monarch, but Hoveida's tenure as PM attests to how this portrayal was not an objective reflection of circumstances. Hoveyda's premiership would be the pivot behind his resistance to such powerlessness. Hoveyda became a household name in Iran through the constant character assassination he received by [_Towfigh Magazine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towfigh \"Towfigh\"), Iran's most popular political satire magazine. Hoveyda was largely unknown among the population of Iran before _[Towfigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towfigh \"Towfigh\")_ publicized him. He was caricatured in _[Towfigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towfigh \"Towfigh\")_'s weekly magazine carrying a cane (caused by a traffic accident in which he was involved), wearing one carnation in his suit jacket pocket, and smoking a pipe. _[Towfigh Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towfigh \"Towfigh\")_ referred to him as \"The Caned One\" and even devoted an entire book dedicated to exposing his flaws as a premier entitled \"Assa-Nameh\". The magazine (and Iranian media in general) frequently criticized and lampooned Hoveyda, primarily because they intended to criticize the Shah himself, but were unable to directly do so due to censorship. Eventually Hoveyda, by order of the Shah, forever shut down _[Towfigh Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towfigh \"Towfigh\")_ in 1971 due to Towfigh Magazine's heavy criticism of the Shah's corruption and policies. This was despite the fact that Hoveyda publicly claimed that criticism of the government was to be encouraged, and whereby any restriction of press freedoms had to be by court order through the judiciary and not by unilateral orders of the government.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-9)\n\nThe first half of Hoveyda's premiership is marked by a sense of optimism. As already mentioned, in 1966, Hoveyda attempted to allure many elements of the intellectual community, as well as the opposition, into an informal agreement with the regime. Although talks between the two sides eventually broke down, Hoveyda never lost sight of what a partnership between the two could have accomplished. His pragmatic approach to politics allowed him to envision an incremental reform process that can be carried out through action. This is contrary to the path assumed by many Iranian intellectuals at the time, which involved quixotic solutions to problems such as electoral corruption and media censorship. Hoveyda resumed many of the reform initiatives set out by the Mansour administration. In particular, reform plans that were laid out by the Shah in the [White Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Revolution \"White Revolution\"). Although a [secularist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularist \"Secularist\"), he would even allocate government revenue to the clerical establishment. The clerical establishment was seen as a bulwark against Communism by the Shah, and was constantly reinforced (a policy that the Shah would later regret).\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Hoveida_And_Malak_Hossein.jpg/500px-Hoveida_And_Malak_Hossein.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoveida_And_Malak_Hossein.jpg) Hoveyda and Jordanian [King Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Hussein \"King Hussein\")\n\nHoveyda's plan to crack down on [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption \"Political corruption\") became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and turned a blind eye to the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a [cynic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(contemporary) \"Cynicism (contemporary)\"). After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue in the grand scheme of [modernization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernization \"Modernization\"). In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and [Ardeshir Zahedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeshir_Zahedi \"Ardeshir Zahedi\"), son of the famed participant in the [1953 coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ajax \"Operation Ajax\") against Mossadegh, General [Fazlollah Zahedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazlollah_Zahedi \"Fazlollah Zahedi\").\n\n## Minister of Court and final years\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Minister of Court and final years\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_-_Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_%282%29.jpg/500px-Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_-_Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_%282%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_-_Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_(2).jpg) Hoveyda with the Shah, 1978[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_in_Iraq_-_Saddam_Hussein_as_host_-_1975.jpg/440px-Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_in_Iraq_-_Saddam_Hussein_as_host_-_1975.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda_in_Iraq_-_Saddam_Hussein_as_host_-_1975.jpg) Amir-Abbas Hoveyda in Iraq - [Saddam Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein \"Saddam Hussein\") as host - 1975\n\nOn 2 March 1975, the shah dissolved the [Iran Novin Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Novin_Party \"Iran Novin Party\") and its opposition elements in creating a single party system headed by the [Rastakhiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastakhiz_Party \"Rastakhiz Party\") (Resurgence/Resurrection) Party. In relation to Hoveyda, it is believed that the shah was being threatened by the growing influence wielded by party officials, Hoveyda being the most notable. The growth of an independent apparatus was contrary to the Shah's contrivance involving the consolidation of all power. Hoveyda's inability to garner any type of power base in government allowed him to concentrate much of his energy on developing the Iran Novin Party\\[ _[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_\\]. The networks he had slowly developed over the years came to trouble the monarch. Although Hoveyda would be coerced into relinquishing his position as prime minister, he accepted a temporary intermediary role as secretary general of Rastakhiz before a new Prime Minister can be appointed. Nevertheless, the Shah still saw Hovedya as a trusted (if not pliable) figure, and he was appointed to be minister of court. In her memoirs, Queen Farah wrote that asking Hoveyda to leave the post of prime minister was as painful as \"giving birth to a baby\".\n\nHoveida would serve as minister of court within [Jamshid Amouzegar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshid_Amouzegar \"Jamshid Amouzegar\")'s government in 1977. With this role, he would come to discover the pervasiveness of internal corruption, once concealed by [Asadollah Alam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asadollah_Alam \"Asadollah Alam\") and the team he had surrounded himself with. Nevertheless, he continued to tolerate the practice as well, while simultaneously remaining a trusted advisor to the Shah.\n\nHoveyda was alleged to have been the author of an article which attacked the opposition figure the [Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayatollah_Ruhollah_Khomeini \"Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\") as being a British agent and a liar, which was anyonymously published in _[Kayhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayhan \"Kayhan\")_ newspaper in January 1978 on the Shah's orders. Whether or not the allegations were true, the article generated a major backlash among Khomeini's supporters, which eventually spiralled into the [Iranian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution \"Iranian Revolution\").\n\nAt this point, the growing tide of revolution was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda ample opportunity to leave the country before revolutionary forces could have had a chance to overthrow the monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends to leave the country as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida's decision can also be assessed from alternate angles. For one, he did not want to abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. With all these points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and that everything would eventually straighten out, allowing the country to resume its present course.\n\nIn an effort to slow down the momentum of the revolution, the Shah was advised by many of his surrounding advisors to arrest Hoveida, using him as a scapegoat for the past-ills of the crumbling regime. Since Hoveyda was widely seen as a major cause of the revolution due to much of the bad press he had generated throughout the years by newspapers that wanted to indirectly attack the Shah's policies, they reasoned that the public would be appeased. In September, Hoveyda was forced to resign his position of Minister of Court. On 7 November 1978, Hoveyda was arrested together with other 60 former officials.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-nikaz80-10) He would be held under house arrest in an upper-Tehran residence often affiliated with [SAVAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK \"SAVAK\") activity, and the Shah assumed that he would be put on trial, and freed after publicly vindicating himself.\n\nHowever, once the Shah fled the country, the [SAVAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK \"SAVAK\") (Iranian state security) agents assigned with the task of guarding Hoveyda, absconded from their posts, leaving Hoveida open to arrest by revolutionary forces. Hoveyda refused requests by friends and relatives to flee Iran before it was too late, and instead turned himself over to the new authorities. Hoveyda believed that as the trial would be before an Islamic court, and that he personally had done nothing wrong, he would be acquitted.\n\n## Trial and execution\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Trial and execution\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Hoveida_in_Court.jpg/440px-Hoveida_in_Court.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoveida_in_Court.jpg) Hoveyda in Islamic Revolutionary Court, Tehran, 1979\n\nHoveyda was taken to the [Refah School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refah_School \"Refah School\"), a temporary headquarters for the revolution's vanguard. Because of the departure of the Shah and much of the now former ruling class, Hoveyda had become the most prized prisoner of the old government. On 15 March 1979, he would face the newly established [Revolutionary Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Court \"Islamic Revolutionary Court\") for the first time. During this time he attempted to create his legal arguments for the court. He was interviewed by Belgian journalist [Christine Ockrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Ockrent \"Christine Ockrent\"), a now infamous interview in which Hoveyda was subject to near accusatory questions by the interviewer.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-11)[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-12)\n\nThe clerical judge appointed by Khomeini, [Sadegh Khalkhali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadegh_Khalkhali \"Sadegh Khalkhali\"), would come to be known as the 'Hanging Judge' for his violent approach to revolutionary justice. He was the head of the tribunal that had assembled to try the former prime minister. Prior to Hoveyda's trial, Khalkhali had already ordered the execution of dozens, possibly hundreds of political prisoners, and would eventually be responsible for thousands of executions. Traditional conventions of the judiciary had all but been abandoned during the trials of Hoveyda and countless others. Among many of the anomalous traits personified by the trial, the court ignored notions of due process, impartiality of the judge, or allowing the defendant to consult legal options. Many pundits have come to conclude that the verdict was already made by the [Ayatollah Khomeini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayatollah_Khomeini \"Ayatollah Khomeini\") before the trial ever commenced. Khalkhali's indictment of Hoveyda was as follows:[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-13)\n\nAmir Abbas Hoveyda, son of Habibollah, birth certificate number 3542, issued in Tehran, born in 1298 (1919), previously minister of the deposed royal court, and the Shah's ex-Prime Minister, a citizen of Iran, is accused of:\n\n01.

Many of the charges were never substantiated and often reflected uninvestigated rumours of the day. Abbas Milani agrees with this notion when he described the essence of the court's ambience:\n\n> _It became clear that rules of evidence, notions of innocence until proven guilty, and a dispassionate judge, dispensing impartial judgments based on incontrovertible evidence, were all alien to this court … Gossip had the authority of fact, as evident in article fifteen of the indictment, and unsubstantiated rumours were taken as proof of guilt._\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Aahexecuted.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aahexecuted.jpg) Hoveyda's body, after his execution\n\nOn 7 April 1979, Hoveyda was transported to [Qasr Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasr_Prison \"Qasr Prison\"), once a getaway palace for monarchs of the [Qajar dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty \"Qajar dynasty\"), but converted into a prison during the 1920s. By this time, he was now aware that there would be no mercy for him, and the whole charade would end in his own murder. Quickly shuffled back in front of Khalkhali's tribunal, he once again heard the court's indictment at three in the afternoon. There is some speculation as to who ordered the resumption of the trial. [Bani Sadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolhassan_Banisadr \"Abolhassan Banisadr\"), one among many leaders of the [Provisional Revolutionary Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_Government_of_Iran_(1979) \"Interim Government of Iran (1979)\") who advocated a public trial, states that only [Khomeini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khomeini \"Khomeini\") himself had the authority to make such an order. Behind locked doors, Hoveyda's fate, which had already been decided by Khomeini days earlier, was sealed.\n\nKhalkhali repeatedly yelled at and insulted Hoveyda during much of the trial, calling him \"a corrupter of the earth\" and a \"Western criminal puppet\", refusing to allow him to make a testimony in his defense. In defiance, Hoveyda denounced Khalkhali and informed him that he had no intention of defending himself any longer in front of a sham court. Immediately, Khalkhali announced his sentence, death by [firing squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_squad \"Firing squad\") and confiscation of all material possessions.\n\nMinutes later, the former Prime Minister was taken into the prison's yard. Before reaching the area designated for firing squad executions, [Hojatoleslam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hojatoleslam \"Hojatoleslam\") [Hadi Ghaffari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadi_Ghaffari \"Hadi Ghaffari\") pulled out a pistol and shot Hoveyda twice in the neck. He was left on the ground in agony, begging for the executioners to \"finish him off\". Seconds before the coup de grace was at last given, Hoveyda is said to have gasped to the guard standing over him: \"It wasn't supposed to end like this\".[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-14) According to the autopsy report, he apparently also was beaten shortly before his execution.\n\nHoveyda's corpse was held in Tehran's morgue for several months after his execution, before it was secretly released to his immediate family and buried in [Behesht-e Zahra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behesht-e_Zahra \"Behesht-e Zahra\") cemetery in Tehran as an unknown deceased.\n\nFollowing his execution, his residence in [A.S.P. Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S.P._Towers \"A.S.P. Towers\") was looted by revolutionaries. According to some witnesses he rarely had any items of luxury nature. His prized possessions were a rocking chair and a library of a few hundred books.\n\n## Personal life\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Personal life\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Hoveida_and_his_wife.jpg/250px-Hoveida_and_his_wife.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoveida_and_his_wife.jpg) Hoveyda and his wife, Leila Emami\n\nOn 19 July 1966, Hoveyda married [Laila Emami](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Laila_Emami&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Laila Emami (page does not exist)\") (1932–2018)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda#cite_note-15) in a small ceremony. Only a small number of guests were invited to attend, including the Shah, [Queen Farah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Pahlavi \"Farah Pahlavi\"), Laila's parents, Hoveyda's mother, and his friend [Manouchehr Shahgholi](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manouchehr_Shahgholi&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Manouchehr Shahgholi (page does not exist)\"), and his wife. The marriage ended five years later in 1971, but the two would remain friends, often traveling together.

Also, identify and list any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but ensure they are not marked as Chilled. Once we have these lists, we can proceed to check the status of each item in terms of whether their standards have been superseded in 2023.\n\n            Here are auxiliary information about the overall task, which may help you understand the intent of the current task:\n            <auxiliary_information>\n            In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the \"dried and dehydrated section\" specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards?\n            </auxiliary_information>\n            If there are available tools and you want to call them, never say 'I will ...', but first call the tool and reply based on tool call's result, and tell me which tool you have called.\n            ",

To accurately determine the items from these sections, we might need to explore more options such as reviewing specific pages or downloading the document for further inspection, or consult additional resources if available.\n\nWould you like me to try accessing other sources or attempt another strategy to gather the needed information on dehydrated items and Frozen/Chilled items?\n\n                Provide me with the next instruction and input (if needed) based on my response and our current task: <task>In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the \"dried and dehydrated section\" specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled.

Two pairs of the Harlequin Shrimp were observed feeding on the Sea Star Phataria unifascialis (Gray, 1840) in the reefs of Huatulco National Park, Mexican Pacific. This paper reports the occurrence of H. picta in Mexican Pacific waters and extends its previous distribution by $1,270\\\\mathsf{k m}$ north of El Ocotal, Costa Rica in the eastern Pacific equatorial zone. In addition, we evaluate the potential distribution of H. picta along the tropical eastern Pacific using the Maximum-Entropy modelling algorithm.\n\nKeywords: Caridea, coral reefs, harlequin shrimp, Huatulco National Park, sea star predator.\n\nHymenocera is a small decapod crustacean (~5cm in TL) belonging to the superfamily Palaemonoidea Rafinesque, 1815 sensu De Grave & Fransen (2011). Due to its amazing coloration, it is one of the most in-demand decapod crustacean species in the marine ornamental trade, reaching up to 80 USD per pair (Calado et al .2003).\n\nHymenocera picta was first described by Dana based on a specimen collected in Raraka, Tuamotu, French Polynesia. Dana’s figures were made from a living specimen; however, holotype specimens were lost in the wreck of the “Peacock” (Edmondson 1923). This event led to the complex and problematic taxonomy for the species (Edmondson 1923). Previously, two nominal species were recognized: Hymenocera elegans Heller,\n\nHymenocera Latreille, 1819 is a monospecific genus that contains Hymenocera picta Dana, 1852, commonly known as “Harlequin Shrimp” or “Painted Shrimp”. 1862 was described as a species with a white or creamy body with blue or brown blotches with a distribution within the Indo-west Pacific (Debelius 1999), while $H.$ .picta differed in the colour of its blotches (wine or red) and with a distribution in the central and eastern Pacific (Hoover 1998). Kawamoto & Okuno (2003) found both colour patterns in Okinawa, Japan suggesting the blotch colour changes according to the species’ diet. As a consequence, H. elegans was re-designated as a junior synonym of H. picta (De Grave & Fransen 2011).\n\nThe Harlequin Shrimp is a monogamous and territorial species that typically live in pairs inhabiting shallow waters and associated with holes, crevices and caves in coral reefs (Wickler 1973). The most particular characteristic of the species is its unique coloration (red or blue blotches in the body), and the morphology of the chela (Debelius 1999). Feeding habits of the Harlequin Shrimp are based exclusively on starfish of the Class Asteroidea Blainville, 1830 (Wickler 1973; Prakash & Kumar 2013), being currently referred to as an important biological control of Fromia monilis (Perrier, 1869), Linckia laevigata (Linnaeus, 1758), Mithrodia fisheri Holly, 1932, Asteropsis carinifera (Lamarck, 1816), Nidorellia armata (Gray, 1840), and Acanthaster planci (Linnaeus, 1758) populations (Wickler 1973; Juncker & Poupin 2009; Prakash & Kumar 2013).\n\nAlthough Hymenocera picta is abundant in the IndoPacific regions (Wickler 1973; Seibt & Wickler 1979; Prakash & Kumar 2013), it has also been recorded in the eastern tropical Pacific in the Galapagos Island (Hickman & Zimmerman 2000), Gorgona Island, Colombia (Juan Felipe Lazarus Agudelo, pers. comm. 17 August 2016), Panamá Islands (Canal de Afuera, Pedro González, Uva and Toboga) (Glynn 1977, 1982; Wicksten & Hendrickx 2003), El Ocotal, Costa Rica (Wicksten & Hernández 2000) and Clipperton Island, France (Debelius 1999; Poupin et al. 2009). In this paper, we report the presence of H. picta in Cacaluta Island and Punta Maguey, Mexican Pacific for the first time, therefore extending its distribution 1, 270km north from its previous record in Central America.\n\n# Material and Methods\n\nThe present record is based on field observations in Huatulco National Park (HNP) of H. picta at two different times. While conducting biological censuses of reef associated invertebrates and vertebrates in HNP, we (OVM and VAP) observed a pair of Harlequin Shrimps in Cacaluta Island (15.71888889 N & -96.16194444 W) on March 2014, and another in Punta Maguey (15.73011 N & -96.14611 W) in July 2016 (Fig. 1). Specimens were observed between $10{-}15\\ m$ depth and recorded with video (GoPro Hero 3) and digital photography (Nikon Coolpix Aw120). No specimens were collected since both sites are part of a Natural Protected Area (NPA) and collecting is forbidden without the adequate scientific collecting permit granted by Mexican federal agencies.\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/tmp/e8dd8b70-7572-4505-a02c-67f276693b88/images/a053eaba331bed57092900981808fec4d87d06e97ad346a117d7825daaf2df79.jpg)\n\nFigure 1. Study area in Huatulco National Park, Mexican Pacific. a - Cacaluta Island; b - Punta Maguey.\n\nSpecimens were further identified by taxonomist (Fernándo Álvarez Noguera, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México; Arthur Anker, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil, and Sanjeevi Prakash, Sathyabama University, India). Finally, the taxonomic validity of the species name was addressed after verification by WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species [http://www](http://www/). marinespecies.org) and ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System [http://www.itis.gov](http://www.itis.gov/)) databases.\n\nFurthermore, information of 13 environmental variables (minimum, maximum and average values of sea surface temperature, primary productivity, particulate organic carbon, particulate inorganic carbon and bathymetry) and historical records of occurrence of H.picta around the tropical eastern Pacific (TEP), were used to predict the potential geographic distribution of the species in cells of 4km latitude/longitude in the area. Environmental variables were downloaded from NASA’s Ocean Color Web ( [http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) and processed using the program WIM (Windows Image Manager [http://www.wimsoft.com](http://www.wimsoft.com/); Kahru 2007). The distribution data of H. picta were gathered from online databases such as Invertebrate Zoology Collections ( [http://collections.mnh.si.edu/](http://collections.mnh.si.edu/)) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( [http://www.gbif.org/](http://www.gbif.org/)). Maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling algorithm version $3.3.3\\\\mathsf{k}$ (Phillips et al. 2006) was used employing default settings. Among the different species distribution model algorithms, Maxent is extensively used for projecting current species distributions (Elith & Leathwick 2009) due to its better predictive performance relative to other modelling algorithms (Elith et al. 2006) even with low sample sizes (Pearson et al. 2007), and its applicability when presence-only data are available (Phillips et al. 2006). Maxent has been described as a modelling method able to fit overly complex environmental response curves (Elith & Leathwick 2009), particularly when using default parameters (Merow et al. 2013); default settings of Maxent have been tested successfully over a wide range of species and environmental conditions (Phillips & Dudík 2008). Finally, probability predictions were interpreted as habitat suitability index (HSI) for H. picta for exploratory purposes only, rather than as the probability of species presence in each cell.\n\n# Results\n\nTwo pairs of Harlequin Shrimp Hymenocera picta of $\\\\mathsf{\\\\sim}4.5\\\\mathsf{c m}$ in TL, were recorded at Cacaluta Island and Punta Maguey respectively, Huatulco National Park, Mexican Pacific (Image 1). Specimens were observed feeding on the sea star Phataria unifascialis (Gray, 1840) in shallow coral reef waters (at $\\\\sim!10\\\\mathsf{m}$ ) dominated by Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) corals. Specimens were identified on the basis of their coloration (white body with blue and wine coloured blotches), and unique morphologic characteristics such as antennule with lateral flagellum greatly expanded, the $3^{r d}$ maxilliped with penultimate segment wider than the antepenultimate and $2^{n\\\\mathsf{d}}$ pereopod greatly expanded following the criteria of Wickler (1973) and Mitsuhashi et al. (2005).\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/tmp/e8dd8b70-7572-4505-a02c-67f276693b88/images/59211cd92d6e5b0e652bcd635e8d33f954e4a3292d380ed110693b6654ce64fa.jpg)\n\nImage 1. Harlequin Shrimp Hymenocera picta observed at Cacaluta’s Island reef. Male (up), female (down).\n\nA total of 47 historical bibliographic references indicate that the harlequin shrimp have a wide geographical distribution in the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 2). In particular, in the eastern Pacific, literature and museum records indicate that H. picta inhabit the oceanic islands of Galapagos, Gorgona, Malpelo, Perlas and Clipperton; but also in coastal zone as El Ocotal, Costa Rica (Fig. 2). The new record for Cacaluta Island and Punta Maguey (Fig. 1) was located about 1, 279km north from El Ocotal, Costa Rica and 1, 529km northeast from Clipperton Atoll. According to the species distribution model (Fig. 3), the TEP may represent a highly suitable habitat for the occurrence of H. picta . At large spatial scale, high habitat suitability $(>!0.92)$ for $H.$ . picta may be found between the Gulf of California and Ecuador, including the eastern Pacific oceanic islands, but suitability predicted by the model decrease $\\_{(<0.85)}$ on the western part of the Baja California peninsula and south of mainland Ecuador. Likewise, bathymetry along with minimum and average sea surface temperature across the TEP is mainly involved in predicting habitat suitability for the species. In particular, habitat suitability for the harlequin shrimp reaches its maximum when minimum sea surface temperature is $25^{\\\\circ}\\\\complement$ in shallow waters $(<!20\\\\mathsf{m})$ ,but suitability decreases exponentially when depth increases, or when minimum sea surface temperature is below $25%$ .\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/tmp/e8dd8b70-7572-4505-a02c-67f276693b88/images/221adf9f104f4dbbb47e53bfaddb5076d13aa6e130de89fe17b28c2e2de8c8ed.jpg)\n\nFigure 2.

In addition, morphological characteristics observed in Cacaluta Island and Punta Maguey specimens match with those originally addressed by Dana (1852), and in the reviews performed by Wickler (1973) and Mitsuhashi et al. (2005) for specimens recorded in the Indian Ocean, Western and Central Pacific. The new record of $H$ .picta at Cacaluta Island and Punta Maguey, increase the number of new records of crustacean species (GarcíaMadrigal & Andreu-Sánchez 2010; Cortés-Carrasco & García-Madrigal 2013) in the area, but most importantly extends the former distribution of the species by 1, 270km north from Costa Rica (Wicksten & Hernández 2000) and 1, 529km northeast from Clipperton (Debelius 1999; Poupin et al. 2009). The record of $H.$ . picta in Mexican Pacific waters, is part of a long list of new records of species previously known to occur in Central America in taxonomic groups as varied as echinoderms (Granja-Fernández et al. 2013), fish (López -Pérez et al. 2010; Zepeta-Vilchis et al. 2013), polychaeta (BastidaZavala & Guevara-Cruz 2012) and crustaceans (GarcíaMadrigal & Andréu-Sánchez 2010; Cortés-Carrasco & García-Madrigal 2013). The new record of H. picta presented here along with the above-mentioned records, reinforces the faunal connectivity hypothesis between Central America and southwestern Mexico via the Costa Rica Coastal Current (Fiedler & Talley 2006; Pineda et al. 2007).\n\nConsidering the new record presented here, H. picta is distributed as north as southern Mexican Pacific. Species distribution model (Fig. 3) suggest that, at large spatial scale, habitat suitability for the species may extend as far north as the Gulf of California and as far south as the frontier between Ecuador and Peru, corresponding to the full extension of the TEP, whose the most northern and southern distribution limits was defined by the minimum sea surface temperature. According to the model the entire TEP is suitable to harbour H. picta populations, but at small spatial scale that may depend upon the distribution of coral reefs communities and prey availability. Several studies indicate that Harlequin Shrimps inhabit holes and crevices of coral reefs (Glynn 1977, 1982) and prey exclusively upon on starfish of the Class Asteroidea (Wickler 1973; Prakash & Kumar 2013), not only in the eastern Pacific (Glynn 1977, 1982) but across its entire distribution (Prakash & Kumar 2013). During the current study, we observed the harlequin shrimp feeding on the starfish P.unifascialis , while field observations on coral reefs in the Gulf of Chiriquí (Panamá) showed that H. picta feeds on A. planci (Ormond & Campbell 1974; Glynn 1977, 1982). Regardless of the biology (feeding habits), ecology (distribution), and prediction model (Maxent) of H. picta , future detailed prospecting of coral communities and reefs from the eastern Pacific may render more insights on new species records in this area.\n\n# References\n\nBastida-Zavala, J.R. & C.

              "THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT\nON SEX DETERMINATION IN HARLEQUIN SHRIMP\n(HYMENOCERA PICTA : DECAPODA, GNATHOPHYLLIDAE)\nG. Curt Fiedler\nSesoko Station, Tropical Biosphere Research Center, University of the Ryukyus, 3422 Sesoko,\nMotobu-cho, Okinawa 905-0227, Japan (e-mail: kaatosan@hotmail.com)\nABSTRACT\nHarlequin shrimp, Hymenocera picta , are monogamous and pair-bonding, and are usually found in\nisolated singles and pairs in the ﬁeld. The apparent rarity of this species in their habitat and high levels ofaggression between consexuals suggests the possibility of some sort of plasticity in their primary sex\ndetermination. In this study, the inﬂuence of social environment upon primary sex determination in\nH. picta was examined experimentally in the laboratory. Naı ¨ve juveniles were placed in three novel social\nenvironments: paired juveniles, single juveniles, and adult/juvenile pairs. Spacing behavior and the onset\nof external differentiation were observed during long-term experiments for each social treatment. Gonadal\ndevelopment was also observed. Spacing behavior of paired shrimp reﬂected the sexual composition ofsocial groups; high intrapair distance (IPD) for same-sex pairs and low IPD for opposite-sex pairs. Sexdetermination results were not so clear. Two of the three paired juvenile replicates displayed phenotype\nfrequencies different from those expected from a random sample of gonochoristic organisms with a 1:1\nsex ratio. However, the third replicate and the combined frequencies did not show any statistical differencefrom the hypothetical random sample. Furthermore, single juveniles and those paired with adultsexpressed sex in nearly 1:1 ratios, regardless of the sex of adult conspeciﬁcs. Histological examination of\njuvenile shrimp conﬁrmed that sex was determined as early as four weeks after larval metamorphosis.\nTherefore, social environment had no clear effect upon sexual phenotype expressed. However, singlefemales attained puberty at a signiﬁcantly greater age and larger size than did females paired with males.\nHence for H. picta , social environment had a measurable effect on the timing of female puberty. This is the\nﬁrst demonstration of this phenomenon in decapod Crustacea.\nThe phenomenon of environmental sex de-\ntermination (ESD) (Bull, 1983) is well docu-\nmented in many teleost ﬁsh families in the\nform of some sort of sequential hermaphrodit-ism (Atz, 1964; Smith, 1975; Yogo, 1987).\nThe best such examples in ﬁsh involve the\nsocial environment and its effect on sex (e.g.,Fricke and Fricke, 1977; Moyer and Nakazono,1978; Warner, 1982). In crustaceans, however,\nthere appears to be little direct evidence of so-\ncial control of functional sex. The best knownexamples occur in parasitic bopyrid isopods\nand protandrous hermaphrodite shrimp of the\nfamily Pandalidae. In bopyrid examples, theﬁrst individual to reach a host becomes female\nand may cause subsequent conspeciﬁcs to be-\ncome male (Reverberi, 1944; Reinhard, 1949;Charniaux-Cotton et al. , 1983). In pandalid\nshrimp, the timing of male-female sex change\nis thought to be inﬂuenced by the demo-\ngraphics of their populations (Charnov, 1982).However, the mechanism of such a system is\nin doubt (Bergstro ¨m, 1997).Examples of hermaphroditism in the mala-\ncostracan Crustacea are relatively uncommon\nand usually are in the form of protandrous sex\nchange. Hermaphroditism is known from manyspecies in a few subgroups of isopods and tanai-\ndaceans (Charniaux-Cotton, 1975; Policansky,\n1982). However, only approximately 42species of decapod crustaceans are thought tobe hermaphroditic, and 35 of these are caridean\nshrimp (see lists in Carpenter, 1978; Policansky,\n1982; Bauer, 2000) (and for additional exam-ples see Kagwade, 1981; Sukumaran, 1981;\nBauer, 1986; Nakashima, 1987; Gherardi and\nCalloni, 1993; Gavio et al. , 1994; Rudolph,\n1995; de Almeida and Buckup, 1997, 2000;\nBauer and Holt, 1998; Fiedler, 1998). Further-\nmore, at least two hippolytid carideans in thegenus Lysmata display a form of simultaneous\nhermaphroditism (Bauer and Holt, 1998;\nFiedler, 1998). Because marine decapods share\nmany of the same ecological and habitat selec-tion pressures with teleost ﬁshes, it is surpris-\ning to ﬁnd so few examples in this diverse\n750JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY, 22(4): 750–761, 2002group of crustaceans. Perhaps past research has\nnot focused closely on the best crustacean can-didates for sex change.\nHarlequin shrimp, Hymenocera picta (Dana,\n1852), are small caridean shrimp that may beideal candidates for studies on plastic sex de-\ntermination. They are found in shallow coastal\nwaters (1–30 m) of the tropical Indo-Paciﬁc re-gion but are apparently uncommon throughout\ntheir range (personal observation; Debelius,\n1984). The shrimp are hardy in captivity andare popular aquarium pets, but only eat aster-oid echinoderms (Wickler, 1973; Debelius,\n1984). Males and females are sexually di-\nmorphic and form monogamous pair bondsthat are maintained via mate-guarding behavior\nby males (Wickler, 1973; Seibt and Wickler,\n1979). Both males and females are aggressivetowards individuals of the same sex, and males\nwill readily ﬁght each other to death in an en-\ncounter. Also, adults are not known to changesex. Mature females spawn 100–5,000 eggsevery 18–26 days, concurrent with their molt\ncycle (Seibt and Wickler, 1979; Kraul and\nNelson, 1986). Hymenocera larvae pass\nthrough twelve planktonic zoeal stages and\nreach the settlement stage in 5–6 weeks (Kraul\nand Nelson, 1986; Fiedler, 1994). Postlarvaebegin eating seastars ﬁve days after meta-\nmorphosis (Fiedler, 1994).\nGiven the relative rarity of these animals,\ntheir high intraspeciﬁc aggression, the dispersal\nof their prey, and the low probability of larval\nsurvival, it seems likely that a mechanism en-suring access to the opposite sex would haveevolved. This might be accomplished via the\nability to follow distant chemical cues from the\nopposite sex or a mechanism of environmen-tally (socially) regulated juvenile sex determi-\nnation. Harlequin shrimp certainly ﬁt the\ncriteria for one of three models for the evolu-tion of hermaphroditism proposed by Ghiselin\n(1969). The Low Density Model implies that\nthere is an advantage in ‘‘being able to matewith any member of the species, where theprobability of encountering a suitable mate is\nlow’’ (Ghiselin, 1969: 200). This model sug-\ngests the evolution of simultaneous hermaphro-ditism or labile juvenile sex determination in\nmarine animals, like harlequin shrimp, with\nlimited postlarval dispersal. In this study, I as-sess the presence of such mechanisms in juve-\nnile Hymenocera picta . These experiments\nexamine social inﬂuence on the primary sexdetermination of this species.M\nATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn order to examine the effect of social environment on\nthe primary sex determination of Hymenocera picta , a series\nof ﬁve experiments was carried out in which postlarvae wereplaced into artiﬁcial social situations in the laboratory. In the‘‘Paired Juveniles’’ experiment (replicates I, II, and III),pairs of postlarvae were isolated and observed closely over aperiod of several months. In the ‘‘Single Juveniles’’\nexperiment, postlarvae were isolated individually and\nmonitored. In the ‘‘Adult/Juvenile Pairs’’ experiment, singlepostlarvae were isolated with one adult shrimp. In the‘‘Histology/Morphology Pairs’’ experiment, postlarval pairswere isolated and sacriﬁced at regular intervals in order toexamine morphological characteristics of primary sexdetermination. The three social contexts (juvenile conspe-\nciﬁc, adult conspeciﬁc, and no conspeciﬁc) were intended to\nsimulate the potential social environments that Hymenocera\npicta postlarvae experience in the ﬁeld. All the experiments\nare explained in detail below.\nExperiment One: Paired Juveniles\nIn this experiment, I assessed the presence of socially\nregulated Environmental Sex Determination (ESD) duringthe juvenile phase of Hymenocera picta by observing the\nbehavior and differentiation of isolated juvenile pairs. Underoptimal ESD, we would expect that an isolated pair ofjuvenile shrimp would mature as a male/female pair.\nAdditionally, I expect that spacing behavior would reﬂect\nthe sexes of the pairs as occurs in H. picta adults. Seibt\n(1980) observed artiﬁcial groupings of adult H. picta in the\nlaboratory and found that individuals of the opposite sexwere found in closer proximity than those of the same sex.\nThree replicates of this experiment were performed and\ndesignated as replicates I, II, and III. All three replicates\nwere conducted at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biologyunder similar conditions.\nReplicate I .—Forty-two Hymenocera picta postlarvae,\napproximately two weeks postmetamorphosis, were ob-\ntained from the Waikiki Aquarium. Individual shrimp wererandomly selected, by drawing numbers from a hat, andplaced into twenty pairs. The two extra shrimp were heldin reserve and not used. Shrimp pairs were isolated in small(8 l) plastic buckets. The buckets were arranged in twowet tables and provided ﬂowing sea water via a polyvinyl\nchloride (PVC) pipe frame in each wet table. Buckets had\nholes drilled approximately 4 cm under the rim to facilitatewater ﬂow. Each bucket was provided with its own aerationsource. Shrimp were fed small (approximately 1 cm) piecesof seastar ( Linckia spp.) ad libitum during the experiment.\nDecaying food and detritus were siphoned from the buckets\nas needed.\nPairs were monitored for seven months (1 July 1991–8\nFebruary 1992). The data recorded during the experimentincluded the Intra-Pair Distance (IPD), total length (TL), andsecondary sex characteristics. These data were recordeddaily during the ﬁrst month of the experiment and atincreasingly longer intervals (2–7 d) in the remaining six\nmonths. I measured IPD with a transparent, ﬂexible ruler,\nrecording the linear distance separating two shrimp betweenthe bases of their respective antennae. Total length (TL) wasrecorded weekly by carefully removing shrimp from theircontainers with a clear glass beaker that was then placedabove an opaque plastic ruler. The TL was recorded as the\nlinear distance between the tips of the rostrum and the\nuropod. Although carapace length (CL) would have been amore reliable indication of size, measuring TL was most751 FIEDLER: SEX DETERMINATION IN HYMENOCERA PICTAexpedient and less stressful to these delicate shrimp. The\nonset date of maturity (appearance of secondary sexcharacters) was determined by carefully examining the ventralabdomen of shrimp for female characteristics. Characteristicsof female puberty included the presence of white or red\npigment and eggs on pleopods. Although males possess\nmorphologically distinct pleopods, they remain transparent.This made it difﬁcult to record the presence of structures suchas the appendix masculina on living individuals. Therefore,male puberty was recorded as the date at which an individualwas able to fertilize its partner (if female). The sex of\nmorphologically indistinct individuals was inferred by\nplacing them with adults of known sex and observing theirstereotypical behavior (Wickler and Seibt, 1970). Unusual orobviously agonistic behavior was also noted throughout theexperiment.\nReplicate II .—For this replicate, postlarvae were obtained\nfrom a clutch reared by the author (for larval rearingprotocol, see Fiedler, 1994) at the Hawaii Institute of MarineBiology. Forty experimental postlarvae were randomlyselected from a total of 86 healthy individuals 2–4 weekspast metamorphosis. The experimental procedure was\nidentical to replicate I with the following exception: IPD\nwas measured every 5–7 d throughout the experiment,which ran for approximately 6 months (4 July 1992–28December 1992).\nReplicate III .—For this replicate, forty postlarvae were\nobtained from a clutch of 61 reared by the author (as above).These postlarvae metamorphosed 1–4 weeks prior to theexperiment. The experimental procedure was identical toreplicate I, with the following exceptions. First, IPD wasrecorded every 1–3 days for approximately the ﬁrst threemonths and at increasingly longer intervals (3–11 days) for\nthe rest of the experiment. Second, the experiment ran for\nmore than eight months (25 May 1995–28 January 1996).\nExperiment Two: Single Juveniles\nAs a control and comparison for paired juvenile\ndevelopment, postlarvae were isolated singly and observed\nas above. If sex determination in this species is sociallyregulated ESD, I hypothesize that single shrimp experi-encing the same social environment (no conspeciﬁc) woulddifferentiate as the same sex (either all males or females). Analternative hypothesis is that the presence of no conspeciﬁc\nrepresents no social environment, and individuals will\nmature as males or females in equal proportions.\nTwenty postlarvae were randomly chosen from the same\nclutch used for Paired Juveniles, replicate II. Shrimp weremaintained in buckets, as above, in a single large wet table.The experiment duration was 11 months (4 July 1992–15June 1993). All individuals were observed (same schedule\nas Paired Juveniles II) for presence of secondary sex\ncharacteristics (female) and measured (TL) when sex couldbe judged. The sex of all individuals was veriﬁedbehaviorally at the completion of the experiment.\nExperiment Three: Adult/Juvenile Pairs\nIn the ﬁeld, it is unlikely that juveniles encounter only\njuvenile conspeciﬁcs. To simulate such natural conditions,newly metamorphosed individual juveniles were randomlypaired and isolated with sexually mature adult individuals.Cues from adult shrimp may have a more pronounced effect\nupon the ESD of juveniles. If this is the case, juveniles\nshould predominantly mature as the opposite sex of theiradult partners.Sixteen postlarvae were randomly selected from the same\nclutch used for Paired Juveniles, replicate III. Half of thesewere individually paired with adult male Hymenocera picta .\nThe other half were individually paired with adult females.Nine of the adults were wild-caught, whereas seven others\nwere laboratory-reared (some left over from Paired Juveniles\nreplicate II). The animals were maintained and observed asin the Paired Juveniles experiment, with the followingexceptions. First, experimental buckets were larger (12 l)and each was provided with a standard shelter ( ;5c m\nlength of 3.8-cm diameter PVC pipe half) as a refuge for the\nsmall juveniles. Second, IPD and shrimp TL were measured\non the same schedule as Paired Juveniles, replicate III.Third, the onset of juvenile maturity was assessed bydetermining the presence of external female sex character-istics or fertility of partner’s eggs. In the cases wherejuvenile sex was ‘‘unknown,’’ shrimp were sexed behavior-ally. The duration of this experiment was approximately\nseven months (24 May 1995–31 December 1995).\nExperiment Four: Morphology/Histology Pairs\nIf the sex determination of Hymenocera picta juveniles is\nplastic or labile, there may be evidence of bipotentiality injuvenile gonads and in some external secondary sexcharacteristics. Therefore, histological examination of pairedjuveniles sacriﬁced during the putative maturation periodwas undertaken.\nTen pairs of juveniles were randomly selected from\nremnants of the clutch used for the Paired Juveniles,\nreplicate II and Single Juveniles experiments. Pairs wereisolated and maintained in buckets in the same manner usedin the Paired Juveniles experiment. Behavioral and spacingobservations were not made during this experiment. Overthe course of the experiment (5 July 1992–19 September\n1992), pairs were selected at random at approximately 7-d\nintervals (beginning 23 July 1992) and sacriﬁced forhistological examination. Sacriﬁced shrimp were ﬁxed in10% seawater Formalin. Fixed shrimp were examined andmeasured (TL and CL) under a dissection microscope. Theappendages, abdomen, and carapace were then excised from\nﬁxed specimens. The remaining cephalothorax was em-\nbedded in paraplast media following decalciﬁcation (withFisher brand CalEx), dehydration (EtOH), and clearing(toluene). The entire cephalothorax was used in order toobserve the location and morphology of gonoducts. In allcases, 8 lm transverse serial sections were made for detailed\nobservation of the morphology and histology of the entire\ngonad. Sections were mounted on glass slides, stained with\nHarris progressive hematoxylin and eosin (Galigher andKozloff, 1971), and examined with a compound microscope.\nData Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using the software\npackage ‘‘StatView v.5.01’’ on a Macintosh PowerPCcomputer. For all experiments, observed frequencies ofexpressed sexes were compared with expected frequenciesin a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test. Expected frequencies\nused were generated extrinsically to reﬂect the 1:1 male/\nfemale sex ratio observed in the ﬁeld. In this way, I determinedwhether the observed frequencies are signiﬁcantly differentfrom those expected from gonochoristic animals without ESD.\nI compared the overall average IPDs for all pair types in\neach Paired Juveniles and Adult/Juvenile Pairs experiment\nin a one-way ANOVA. In this way, I determined whether\ngroup composition (pair types) had a signiﬁcant effect uponIntra-Pair Distance. Multiple pair-wise comparisons were752 JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY, VOL. 22, NO. 4, 2002made using a Scheffe ´’spost hoc test because of unequal\nsample sizes and concerns about data normality.\nUsing a one-way MANOVA, age and size of female\npuberty was compared between isolated individuals, thosepaired with males, and those paired with other females.\nAgain, a post hoc Scheffe ´’s test was employed to deter-\nmine differences between ‘‘treatments’’ for both puberty sizeand age.\nRESULTS\nExperiment One: Paired Juveniles\nSexes of Pairs .—In replicate I, 10 pairs\ndifferentiated into male/female pairs (MF), nine\nbecame male/male pairs (MM), and one pairmatured as female/female (FF). A 1:1 sex ratio\n(based on unpublished ﬁeld collections) was\nused to generate expected frequencies (50%MF, 25% MM, 25% FF) for a Chi-Squaregoodness of ﬁt test (GOF). The GOF test\napplied to replicate I counts indicated a\nsigniﬁcant deviation from expected counts(Chi-Sq. ¼6.40, d.f.¼2,P¼0.041).\nIn replicate II, 14 pairs differentiated as MF,\nnone as MM, and ﬁve as FF. One pair couldnot be judged, as one shrimp died and was too\ndeteriorated to examine. These data indicated\nthat the observed combinations deviated signif-icantly from expected values (Chi-Sq. ¼6.90,\nd.f.¼2,P¼0.032).\nIn replicate III, 12 pairs differentiated as\nMF, three as MM, four as FF, and one pair suf-\nfered early mortality and could not be deter-mined. The resulting Chi-Square GOF analysis\nshowed that observed counts did not deviate\nsigniﬁcantly from expected values (Chi-Sq. ¼\n1.42, d.f.¼2,P¼0.491).\nI applied the same analysis for combined\ndata from all three Paired Juveniles experi-ments. The total counts were 36 MF, 12 MM,and 10 FF pairs. The GOF test indicated that\ncounts were not statistically different from\nexpected values (Chi-Sq. ¼3.52, d.f.¼2,\nP¼0.172).\nIntra-Pair Distance and Sex of Shrimp .—\nRepresentative IPDs for MF, MM, and FFpairs over the duration of the experiments are\ngraphed in Fig. 1. For each experiment, IPDs\nof MF pairs were typically low or becamelower following female puberty. Same-sex pairs(MM and FF) remained highly spaced over the\nentire experiment but varied more. Mean IPDs\nfor each replicate (I, II, and III) were analyzedto determine if pair type (MF, MM, FF) can\naccount for variance in mean IPD. Hence,\nANOVA was performed with pair types (MF,MM, FF) as an independent variable and\naverage IPD of each pair as the dependent\nvariable. Then, a post hoc Scheffe ´’s test was\nperformed to determine which pair types\ndiffered. The minimum criterion for statistical\nsigniﬁcance was P/C200.01 in both the ANOVA\nand Scheffe ´’s tests. In each experiment, the pair\ntypes accounted for most of the variation in IPD\n(I:F-value¼30.1, d.f.¼2; II: F-value¼\n122.01, d.f.¼1; III: F-value¼28.54, d.f.¼\n2; actual P,0.0001 for I, II, III). Post hoc\nScheffe ´’s tests for each experiment (Fig. 2a–c)\nshowed that MF IPDs were lower than MM(actual P,0.0001). The MF and FF IPDs were\nsigniﬁcantly different in replicates II and III\n(actual P,0.0001 and P¼0.0018, respec-\ntively) but not in replicate I (actual P¼0.15).\nThe FF and MM IPDs did not differ signiﬁ-\ncantly in any replicate.\nExperiment Two: Single Juveniles\nSexes of Individuals .—In the Single Juveniles\nexperiment, eighteen of twenty individuals\nsurvived and could be sexed. Of these, ten indi-viduals were judged as male, and the remain-\ning eight were female. These results do not\nFig. 1.

Arrows represent the dates of female pubertyonset.753 FIEDLER: SEX DETERMINATION IN HYMENOCERA PICTAindicate a signiﬁcant deviation from a 1:1 sex\nratio (Chi-Sq. ¼0.22, d.f.¼1,P¼0.637) for\nisolated individuals. Therefore, there is no\nsupport for the hypothesis that shrimp maturing\nalone (under identical social context) are likelyto differentiate as one sex or the other. This\nalone, however, does not rule out the effect of\nsocial environment on expressed sex.\nTiming and Size of Female Differentia-tion.—The mean ages and sizes of maturity in\nfemales were compared for females in thePaired Juveniles (replicate II) and Singlesexperiments (Fig. 3). Data from only these\nexperiments were used, as they were run\nconcurrently and from the same clutch ofpostlarvae. A MANOVA was used to test the\nnull hypothesis that the treatment experienced\nby a given female (female in an MF pair, femalein an FF pair, and single female) had no effect\nFig. 2. Comparisons of average IPD for all pair types. Bars designated with different letters are signiﬁcantly different at P/C20\n0.01 level, as determined by a Scheffe ´’s test (all pair-wise comparisons). Error bars represent one standard error of the mean.\nFor a, b, and c: FF ¼matured as female/female, MF ¼matured as male/female, and MM ¼matured as male/male. For d):\nFf¼adult female and maturing female, Fm ¼adult female and maturing male, Mf ¼adult male and maturing female,\nMm¼adult male and maturing male.754 JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY, VOL. 22, NO. 4, 2002on puberty size and age. The MANOVA\nrejected the null hypothesis for both pubertyage ( F-value¼20.7, d.f.¼2,P,0.0001) and\npuberty size ( F-value¼25.6, d.f.¼2,P,\n0.0001). This demonstrates that the social settingof female shrimp does indeed have an effect on\nthe size and age of puberty. A Scheffe ´’spost hoc\ntest was performed for both puberty size and age(Fig. 3) and showed that single females (SF)\nmatured later ( P,0.0001) and at a larger size\n(P,0.0001) than females from MF pairs\n(F(MF)). While single females also matured at alarger size ( P¼0.0002) than females from\nFF pairs (F(FF)), there was no clear difference\nbetween age of puberty ( P,0.1818). Further-\nmore, F(MF) matured at a lower age\n(P¼0.0032) than F(FF), but there was no\nsigniﬁcant difference in their puberty sizes. Itshould be mentioned that the second maturingfemale in 3 FF pairs matured much later than the\nﬁrst female, much like single females. Thisaccounted for the high variance in FF puberty\nsize and age (Fig. 3). Male age of maturity could\nnot be estimated accurately, as it depended on thepresence of a mature female. However, a\nmaximum estimate of male maturity size was\nmade when possible when female pair-mates ﬁrstspawned fertile eggs. Males appeared to mature at\na smaller size than females in any social context\n(Fig. 3).\nExperiment Three: Adult and Juvenile Pairs\nSexes of Pairs .—In the Adult/Juvenile experi-\nment, only 12 of 16 juveniles paired with adults\ncould be sexed behaviorally, functionally, or\nmorphologically. Four individuals died prema-turely and were found decomposed. Of the\nsurviving shrimp, four juveniles paired with\nadult males became female, and two becamemale. When paired with adult females, three\njuveniles became males and three became\nfemales. A Chi-Square GOF test was per-formed, using a 1:1 sex ratio to calculateexpected frequencies for each treatment. The\ntest indicated that the observed sexes did not\ndiffer signiﬁcantly from expected counts (ChiSq.¼0.67, d.f.¼3,P¼0.881), showing no\neffect of adult sex on the expressed sexes of\njuveniles.\nIPD and Sex of Shrimp .—Intra-Pair Distances\ndid not always decrease over time for MF pairsin this experiment (Fig. 2d). Qualitatively, it\nappeared that all pair types had a greater range\nof IPDs over the course of the experiment thanfor the Paired Juveniles experiment. For quanti-\ntative analysis, experimental pairs were divided\ninto Mf, Mm, Ff, and Fm (capital letter denotesthe adult sex and lower case denotes juvenilesex). Mean IPD for each of these pair types was\ncompared using an ANOVA, which showed\nthat pair sexes did not account for differences inIPD means ( F-value ¼3.75, d.f.¼3,P¼\n0.06), but not convincingly. As in the Paired\nJuveniles experiment, there was a trend forhetero-sex pairs (Mf, Fm) to have lower IPDs.\nHowever, the differences were not statistically\ndifferent.\nExperiment Four: Morphology/Histology Pairs\nSexes of Pairs .—Eight of ten experimental\npairs were available for weekly sacriﬁce during\nthe experiment. Three shrimp disappeared from\ntheir holding containers before they could be\nFig. 3. Comparisons of puberty size and age for females\n(and males) maturing in different social environments. Bars\ndesignated with different letters are signiﬁcantly different at\nP/C200.01, as determined by a Scheffe ´’s test (all pair-wise\ncomparisons). Error bars represent one standard error of themean. Female types are as follows: F(FF) ¼females from\nfemale/female pairs, F(MF) ¼females from male/female\npairs, SF ¼single females. All females were from the same\nclutch, but paired females were observed in the Paired\nJuveniles replicate II experiment, and SF were observed inthe Single Juveniles experiment.755 FIEDLER: SEX DETERMINATION IN HYMENOCERA PICTAselected for sacriﬁce (one pair, and one\nindividual). For the surviving eight pairs, twomatured as MM, four as MF, and two as FF.\nThese values did not differ from (are identical\nto) sex combinations expected from frequenciesgenerated from a 1:1 sex ratio.\nMorphological and Histological Examina-\ntion.—Nearly 130 slides of 17 specimens were\nexamined for microscopic evidence of sex\n(Figs. 4, 5) . All but three possessed a clearhistological indication of sex. Even the smallest\nand youngest specimens (19 d) showed evi-\ndence of internal differentiation. These observa-tions were supported by the presence/absence ofthe male copulatory appendage, the appendix\nmasculina.\nNearly all males possessed deﬁnite lobed\ntestes, sperm ducts, and a terminal sperm sinus\nor ampulla (Fig. 4). Mature ‘‘tack-shaped’’\nsperm were invariably observed in the sinus,duct, and often the gonad lumen of males.\nFemales had two ovary lobes, but oviducts\nwere difﬁcult to discern. Oocytes within eachlobe increased in size toward the lateral portion\nof the gonad (Fig. 5). This indicates a clear pat-\ntern of medial to lateral egg development.However, no secondary vitellogenic oocyteswere observed in any specimens.\nThere were three histologically uncertain\nspecimens in this experiment. One (7A) didpossess structures resembling sperm duct, but\nno testis was evident. However, a clear ap-\npendix masculina was present on its secondpleopods. This specimen appeared poorly\nembedded, and testicular tissue may have been\ninadvertently excised. The other two specimens(4A and 4B) were the oldest individuals andamong the largest. The dorsal portion of serial\nsections of these specimens appeared to have\ncrumbled or fallen away. This is often typical ofvitellogenic oocytes, and fragments of what ap-\npear to be yolk particles were apparent. Further-\nmore, no appendix masculina were observed onthe pleopods of these specimens. It appears that\nboth these individuals were females. Other than\nthe above three shrimp, there were no examplesof ambiguous gonad structure and no evidence\nof a hermaphroditic gonad in any specimen.\nD\nISCUSSION\nSex Determination—Environmental\nor Genetic?\nThe early experiments (Paired Juveniles, rep-\nlicates I and II) indicated that pairs of shrimpmatured in combinations outside what would\nbe expected from gonochoristic organisms withgenetic sex determination and Mendelian sex\nalleles. Taken alone, these data suggest that\nsome factor (such as social environment) in theexperiment inﬂuenced the sex outcome of indi-\nviduals. If, however, sex of conspeciﬁcs was\nan important factor in sex determination, wewould expect to see the results skewed highly\ntowards MF pairs. There was some indication\nof this in replicate II (14 MF, 5 FF, 0 MM).This can be examined by partitioning the ob-served frequencies into two groups (14 hetero-\nsex and 5 same-sex pairs) and performing a\nChi-Square GOF test with expected values forhetero-sex : same-sex as 1:1 (Zar, 1984). This\nanalysis shows that the number of MF pairs is\nresponsible for the nonconformity of the datato expected values.\nIf genetic sex determination (GSD) was pre-\ndominant, what could explain the results in rep-licates I and II? It is possible that the sex ratioof postlarvae was skewed prior to the experi-\nment. In replicate I, shrimp were taken from a\nvery large ( .1,000) clutch of postlarval sib-\nlings. There was no record of sex ratio from the\nentire batch or whether the available postlarvae\nwere a representative sample of the clutch.Male postlarvae could have been predominant\nbecause of higher larval survival for males or\nnonrandom removal from the rearing tanks. Incontrast, all available animals from one clutch\nwere used in Paired Juveniles replicate II, the\nSingles, and the Histology experiments. Afemale-biased sample could explain results ofreplicate II but not the Singles and Histology\nexperiments where there was a clear 1:1 sex\nratio. Therefore, it is possible that an envi-ronmental sex determination (ESD) effect was\npresent for replicate II of the Paired Juveniles\nexperiment, as there is not another likely expla-nation available. A re-analysis of the data sup-\nports this possibility. If the data for replicates I\nand II are analyzed in a GOF test using the sexratios observed in each trial (M:F ¼7:3 and\n7:12, respectively), we see that the observed\nsex combinations in replicate II do not conform\nto expected combinations (P ¼0.039) from the\nexperimental sex ratio. This suggests some en-\nvironmental effect on the outcome of replicate\nII, but the speciﬁc source is not clear.\nFor the rest of the experiments, the results\nclosely mirrored expected values. Paired juve-\nniles in Paired Juveniles replicate III and theMorphology/Histology Pairs experiments con-756 JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY, VOL. 22, NO. 4, 2002trasted sharply with Paired Juveniles replicates\nI and II. Furthermore, combined data from allthe Paired Juveniles experiments generated no\nsigniﬁcant relationship. Also, single shrimp\nshowed no tendency to mature as one or theother sex. It is possible that sex cues from\njuveniles were incomplete or weak, and thiseffect could be multiplied with the combination\nof juveniles. Hence, we might expect a stronger\neffect from adults reared with juveniles. In the\nFig. 4.

All these factors point to\none conclusion: sex for harlequin shrimp is pre-dominantly ﬁxed and unalterable during juve-\nnile and adult life. The histological data provide\neven further support for this conclusion. Hence,clear evidence for ESD in this species is lacking\nfrom these experiments. Even as excellent can-\ndidates for Ghiselin’s ‘‘Low Density Model’’(1969) of hermaphroditism, other mechanisms\nmust be invoked to explain how these sparsely\ndistributed organisms ensure the availability ofsuitable mates. This is comparable to an experi-mental study on the mole crab Hippa paciﬁca\n(see Haley, 1979), which refuted theoretical as-\nsertions that this species should display prot-andric hermaphroditism (Wenner, 1972).\nSocial Environment and Timing of Maturation\nSocial environment may not inﬂuence the\ndirection of expressed sex, but there is good\nevidence that it inﬂuences the timing of female\nmaturation. Single females reached puberty(differentiated externally) nearly 130 days laterthan females from MF pairs (Fig. 3). Single\nfemales were, on average, 22% larger than\nMF-pair females at the onset of puberty (Fig.3). Therefore, single females put energy into\ngrowth at the expense of reproductive develop-\nment. Female reproductive ﬁtness is directly re-lated to size (number of eggs produced), and\neggs spawned without fertilization represent\nwasted resources. Harlequin shrimp females aresimilar to most caridean shrimp in that theygenerally spawn eggs with every molt (Nelson,\n1991). Therefore, lone females that can forego\nsexual maturation and egg production untilmates are present have a selective advantage\nover those that cannot. Conversely, females\nwith an available mate may beneﬁt from repro-ducing as quickly as possible. This would\nensure some reproductive ﬁtness in the face of\nhigh mortality rates or competition with otherfemales for food and mates. These mechanisms\nmay have evolved for this species as a result of\ntheir sparse distribution and limited food source(sea stars). Interestingly, the effect of socialenvironment on the timing of puberty has not\nbeen demonstrated in any other crustacean.\nIt is difﬁcult, however, to explain compari-\nsons to females paired with other females\n(F(FF)). These individuals matured later than\nfemales from MF pairs (Fig. 3) but not lonefemales. However, F(FF) puberty sizes were\nnot different from F(MF) but were statistically\ndifferent from single females. Furthermore,within FF pairs, one female typically matured\nearly (on par with F(MF)), whereas the otherhad much delayed puberty. This manifests it-\nself in the high standard deviation in F(FF)\npuberty age but not size.\nWhat could explain these observations? Con-\nceivably, females paired with other females\nshould maximize their competitive abilities byoutgrowing their partners. Alternatively, limited\nnumbers of available males may select for early\nmaturation to take advantage of any availablemates. Competition for males seems unlikely,as males of this species do not provide any par-\nental care or resources to females and can ferti-\nlize more than one if they are in close proximity(Seibt and Wickler, 1979). Also, the social sys-\ntem of Hymenocera picta has been described as\nmale-enforced monogamy (Seibt and Wickler,1979; Wickler and Seibt, 1981). Differences\nwere noted in the TLs of FF pair mates at most\nstages of Paired Juveniles replicate II. The larg-er female invariably reached puberty earlierthan the smaller within each pair. Also, there\nwas evidence of agonistic interactions in FF\npairs, such as missing appendages and highIPD. These larger females may reach maturity\nearlier than smaller ones simply because they\ncan. In the natural habitat, females would likelydisperse from each other, except if competing\ndirectly for very limited food sources. In the ex-\nperimental buckets, females were forced to stayin relatively close proximity. If the cue for early\nfemale maturation is simply the constant pres-\nence of another conspeciﬁc, forced proximitymay trip this switch. However, competition forfood and agonistic interactions may only allow\nthe larger individual to reach puberty at a nor-\nmal schedule and size. Males were absent;therefore, unless females are competing for fu-\nture available males, it is difﬁcult to explain\nany selective advantage for the early maturationobserved in experimental FF females.\nExperimental evidence for social control of\npuberty timing in other decapods is lacking.The closest example comes from the freshwaterprawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii , in which\nthere are three ontogenetic stages of mature\nmales (Ra’anan and Cohen, 1985; Ra’anan andSagi, 1985). Here, the relative ratios of male\nmorphotypes is ﬁxed, and individuals can shift\n(irreversibly) to the next stage if more ad-vanced individuals are removed from the\npopulation (Ra’anan and Cohen, 1985). This\nresearch parallels the present study in that thetiming of sexual development is dependent759 FIEDLER: SEX DETERMINATION IN HYMENOCERA PICTAupon social environment. However, this is an\nexample of social control of mature male mor-photypes, not social control of the timing of\npuberty onset, as in the present study.\nIntra-Pair Distance and the Pair Bond\nFor juvenile pairs, mean IPD is a reasonable\nindicator of the sex of pair mates, at least for\nMF pairs, supporting Seibt’s (1980) observa-tions on adult pairs. Close proximity is charac-teristic of the pair bond and ‘‘male-enforced’’\nmonogamy in Hymenocera (Seibt and Wickler,\n1979), so it is not surprising. In the presentexperiment, ﬂuctuations in IPD appear to be\nreduced near the time of female puberty in\nmale/female pairs (Fig. 1). This suggests thatclose associations between pair-mates may not\noccur until females reach puberty. If this is the\ncase, the opportunities to inﬂuence the ex-pressed sex of juveniles may be limited to\nadult-juvenile interactions.\nUnfortunately, the IPD data from the Adult/\nJuvenile experiment do not support this. Intra-pair distances appear to ﬂuctuate over the entire\ncourse of the experiment for all pairs, with one\nMF exception (not shown). Furthermore, IPDsfor various sex combinations cannot be distin-\nguished statistically (Fig. 2d). Artifacts of the\nAdult/Juvenile experiment could account forsome of the discrepancies. The buckets were\nlarger, decreasing the chance for close interac-\ntions. Also, the shelters may have allowedjuveniles to hide effectively. However, thisseems unlikely, as shrimp outgrew the shelter\nwithin a few weeks of puberty.\nAnother possibility is that the adults are less\nwilling to associate with small individuals. A\nsmaller female represents a lower quality repro-\nductive opportunity for adult males (fewer eggsper spawning). Adults do show preference and\nsome memory for past pair-mates (Seibt and\nWickler, 1979), and the most of the adults werepaired with larger shrimp prior to the experi-\nment. However, it seems unlikely that these\nanimals could retain a memory of past partnersfor several months. This is the case for thestenopodid shrimp Stenopus hispidus , which\nalso forms long-term monogamous pair bonds\n(Johnson, 1977). Stenopus hispidus does not\nshow individual recognition towards past pair-\nmates if they have been separated for more\nthan an entire molt cycle.\nYet another possibility is the use of food.\nAlthough juvenile/adult pairs were often\nobserved to share the same piece of food, itis possible that competition for food was more\nintense given the larger size of one pair mem-ber. However, the amount of food provided was\nadjusted for the size of shrimp. No data were\ntaken on the amount of food at the time IPDwas measured. Therefore, explanations for IPD\ndifferences between adult/juvenile pairs and\njuvenile pairs are only speculative.\nC\nONCLUSIONS\n1. A variety of artiﬁcial social environments do\nnot appear to have a clear effect on the ex-pressed sexes of cultured juvenile Harlequin\nshrimp ( Hymenocera picta ) in the labora-\ntory.\n2. Spacing behavior, in the form of Intra-Pair\nDistances, was indicative of the sexes of\nyoung shrimp and, occasionally, functionalmaturity.\n3. Social environment did have an effect on\nthe timing of female puberty, as single fe-males matured later and at larger body sizesthan females with male partners. However,\nsingle females matured in a similar amount\nof time as females with female partners, butat smaller sizes.\nA\nCKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI ﬁrst thank the two anonymous reviewers for their\ncorrections and comments on the manuscript.

The format required by the question is a number without any units or symbols.\n</analysis>\n<final_answer>22</final_answer>",

The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and another positive integer less than 10. The error in the data involves two adjacent columns being transposed, excluding the final column and the first three columns.\n\nWe first calculated potential solutions by considering all possible weights (2 to 9) and transposed column indices (3 to 10). After generating potential solutions, we verified each by recalculating the checksums for all provided numbers to ensure the checksum condition holds true.\n\nUpon verification, the only valid solution was found to be with a weight of 7 and transposed columns at index 9. This combination satisfied the checksum condition for all the given numbers.\n</analysis>\n\n<final_answer>7, 9</final_answer>",
